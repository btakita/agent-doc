## Pending / Not Built

<!-- agent:pending patch=replace -->
- [ ] [#bamc] Evaluate graphify as graph layer for code RAG (extend extractors with tree-sitter code parsing)
- [ ] [#nkec] tsift audit: skill drift detection — scan installed skills, compare against manifest, flag stale/broken/missing
- [ ] [#865b] tsift audit: duplicate skill detection — find overlapping skills by description similarity
- [ ] [#ay3j] tsift audit: usage tracking — analyze claude-mem/session history for skill invocation frequency, flag never-used skills
- [ ] [#t3pq] tsift audit: cleanup recommendations — generate actionable prune list with token savings estimates per removed skill
- [ ] [#dt80] tsift audit --report: write drift report to tasks/agent-doc/skills-audit.md (nightly cron target via /schedule)
- [ ] [#cs4r] tsift lint: detect unannotated concepts in markdown — cross-reference plain text against known graph entities (symbols, headings, bold terms), suggest backtick/bold/link annotations
- [ ] [#9jc8] graphify integration: LLM-based entity extraction for semantic layer beyond AST
- [ ] [#jzm8] graphify integration: community detection/clustering over code entity graph
- [ ] [#zv4m] graphify integration: HTML visualization of symbol/dependency graphs
