## Status

 <!-- agent:status patch=replace -->
Queue draining (`queue: go`). Head 7 (JB Run Agent Doc monsterrodholders stall) — matches captured review `#jb-monsterrod-route-ready-wait-stall`: the `[route]` error is the dispatch-only busy ready-wait (gen 281 owns pane %1, busy actor didn't reach a dispatch-ready prompt within 60s). It's **fail-open-after-wait, not a hang** — the route waited then declined to inject into a busy turn. Fix (surface a "waiting for pane (60s)" status in JB so it doesn't look like a stall) is captured in `#jb-monsterrod-route-ready-wait-stall` + `#jb-run-agent-doc-busy-feedback-live-verify`. Struck as duplicate. Heads 1-6 done (2 fixes CI-green + plans/captures).

> **Queue prompt:**

You chose **drain queue now**, so I took the top backlog item (`#recursion-guard-wedge-escape`, backlog priority #1) and shipped **part 1**.

**The gap.** `run` (`agent-doc <FILE>`) already fails closed on a recursive self-owned-pane invocation, but the `start` entry did not. `existing_session_pane_action_from_entry` returns `None` when the current pane is the owner (intentional, for legitimate same-pane restart), so `agent-doc start <FILE>` run *inside the Codex pane that already owns the doc* fell through and spawned a replacement owner — looping re-injection of `agent-doc <FILE>` into the owner pane. That is the wedge with no clean operator escape.

**The fix (f24889fc, origin/main).**
- New `run::recursive_codex_start_invocation_diagnostic` — a Codex-only owner-pane self-invocation detector (gated on `detect_harness() == "codex"`, so a legitimate restart from a bare shell after the supervisor exits is **not** blocked).
- `start::run_with_reap_policy` now calls it right after resolving the pane, *before* any pane relocation or owner spawn, and bails. It fires **unconditionally** (even under `--force`) because the deadlock is inherent to same-pane nesting.
- Bail logs `start_recursive_self_owned_pane_refused` and prints a one-line out-of-pane recovery: reconcile a possibly stale-busy actor with `agent-doc session status <FILE>`, then if genuinely wedged run `agent-doc session interrupt-clear <FILE>` from a *different* pane.
- Unit test on the message; spec note in `specs/07-core-commands.md`. `make check` green, `cargo build --release` + `cargo install --path .` both done so the fix is live.

**Why the item stays open (part 2 remaining).** The bug also asks for a `session clear`/`interrupt-clear` **force path** that kills the wedged owner pane + supervisor PID and clears the registry in one command — a destructive change warranting its own turn + live verification. Re-scoped the backlog item to that remaining work.

**Closeout churn — this turn reproduced your bug live.** While I was working, you edited the queue (finished the line-43 note, removed the duplicate, added two new bug reports, removed `#recursion-guard-wedge-escape` from the queue). The `finalize` tripped `live_prompt_drift_after_preflight`, the cycle got stuck in `response_captured` with a stale 19841-byte snapshot vs your 17146-byte cleaned file, and I recovered via `reset --from-current --preserve-session` + this `write --commit` repair (deliberately avoiding queue-consume so your current queue head — the `File Cache Conflict` bug report — was **not** struck). Your queue edits are all preserved. This is direct evidence for `#queue-dedup-destroys-intentional-duplicates` / `#monsterrod-queue-items-deleted-live`: a live queue edit during an open cycle still forces a stale-snapshot recovery dance.

## Queue

<!-- agent:queue preset="#spec-test-build-install-commit-push" priority go -->
- ~~:pushpin: Every JB `File Cache Conflict` that is applied causes the md file to lose its plugin syntax highlighting...falling back to the default markdown syntax highlighting. ~~
- do [#ipc-listener-dewedge-direct-disk]
- :pushpin: A backlog with `queue` attribute should immediately add to the queue. Prioritize both using auto-dag if `priority` attribute is present. A free-text addition to a queue should be have :pushpin: applied. Also, the queue items, if they were prioritized, are missing the :round_pushpin: annotation.
- :pushpin: The previous and next items in the queue I was editing were uncommitted deleted by agent-doc.
- :pushpin: Completed items were not marked as completed in the queue...such as "The JB + VSCode plugin should bold any markdown that is **bold**, italicize any markdown that is *italicized*, and bold + italicize any markdown that is **_bold italicized_**."...which was opportunistically (good behavior that I want to encourage...with the help of auto-dag perhaps?) picked up in a previous turn.

<!--
A recent monsterrodholders.md session had much churn after I edited the queue while a turn was running. One churn item included deleting a queue item that I added.
---
agent-doc reentrant run on equityfundingsource.md had recovery churn.
```
● The recovery is complete and fully consistent. The binary converged the now-drained queue (empty block, queue_active:
  false), no_changes: true, both responses are committed in the session doc, and both code deliverables are on
  origin/main. The auto-loop terminated naturally.

  Let me record the specific recovery path for this failure mode, since it's a recurring dogfooding pattern

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog priority queue --> 
1. [ ] [#recursion-guard-wedge-escape] [recommended] #agent-doc-bug PART 1 SHIPPED (f24889fc origin/main): the `agent-doc start` entry now hard-refuses a recursive self-owned-pane start (run::recursive_codex_start_invocation_diagnostic, Codex-only via detect_harness, fires even under --force) instead of spawning a looping replacement owner; bail logs start_recursive_self_owned_pane_refused and prints an out-of-pane recovery path. REMAINING part 2: `agent-doc session clear`/`interrupt-clear` must offer a force path that kills the wedged owner pane + supervisor PID and clears the sessions registry in one command (today recovery is the multi-step session status then interrupt-clear from another pane). Overlaps #autoloop-command-preemption, plan-jb-run-preempt-autoloop-priority.md sub-part 4; relates #clear-blocked-by-own-drafted-clear-command.
2. [ ] [#partial-staging-closeout-guard] [recommended] #agent-doc-bug closeout guard for partial change-set staging: a turn that edits source + tests can commit a partial set (e.g. queue.rs ~~ render change committed but its test-assertion fixes left unstaged) so local make check passes against the working tree while CI fails against the committed tree only. Observed live this session: 1645112d CI red, fixed dcb734eb. Add a heuristic/guard that flags when committed output-format changes leave companion test files (matching changed string literals) unstaged, or warns the staged diff is not self-consistent. Same "regressions when I work on agent-doc" class.
3. [ ] [#ipc-typing-duplication-family] #agent-doc-bug consolidate IPC/typing full-document duplication prevention (was review #ipcfullprompt-recur2, #finalize-retry-ipc-response-duplication, #ipc-dup-tracking-double-merge, #adoc-queue-ipc-buffer-divergence, #prompt-duplicated-while-typing). PatchWatcher.setText must not duplicate/delete the full document/tail while a prompt is typed; needs JB debug-log setText capture + SimWorld regression + pluginVersion bump. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-full-document-ipc-corruption-typing-prompt.md
4. [ ] [#codex-mcp-server-root-fix] #agent-doc-bug Option A structural root fix: drive Codex agent-doc via an MCP server (persistent session, tool calls) instead of re-shelling agent-doc into the owner pane, removing the recursion/owned-pane deadlock family at the source. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plans/codex-mcp-server-option-a.md
5. [ ] [#live-verify-batch] #agent-doc-bug one consolidated live busy-pane + IPC-timeout verification session for shipped-but-unverified fixes (was ~14 *-live-verify review items). Install signed JB plugin + binary, drive one mid-active-turn Codex pane through the batch, capture route/idea logs. Blocked on live IntelliJ/Codex panes.
6. [ ] [#automated-completion-detection] #agent-doc-bug enhancement: detect item completion from logs/state (ops.log proofs, capture/commit records) so the binary auto-reaps satisfied gated items instead of parking work in agent:review for a human. Operator wants automated review to stop review-item accumulation.
7. [ ] [#stale-busy-after-auto-inject-no-clear] #agent-doc-bug DONE 7b60fcdc (CI 27075841879 green): supervisor idle-queue watch self-heals a stale-busy actor over an idle pane (poll reconcile from has_busy_cue, ~2s debounce, persisted via mark_lifecycle). Re-listed to match the still-pending queue mirror; strike via the queue drain. Live-verify tracked as #stale-busy-self-heal-live-verify.
8. [ ] [#monsterrod-queue-items-deleted-live] [recommended] #agent-doc-bug 2026-06-06 CONFIRMED data loss: a Codex closeout cycle on src/boost-client/tasks/monsterrodholders.md net-removed user-added queue items. Evidence: commit 7c690f1 (9 insertions, 13 deletions) removed active-queue lines including the free-text head "What are #next-steps for ad optimization? Today is 2026-06-06." without completing it (no matching ### Re: / done outcome), alongside a queue->backlog reorg. This is the data-loss facet of the existing #queue-dedup-destroys-intentional-duplicates (dedup collapses intentional duplicates) and #queue-edit-lost-during-finalize-crdt (concurrent user queue edit dropped in the CRDT merge during finalize). Exact mechanism (dedup vs CRDT-merge-overwrite vs queue->backlog migration drop) not yet pinned. Fix must preserve user-added queue items across closeout: provenance-aware dedup or IPC-drift-gated dedup, never silent removal of an uncompleted user head. Plans: tasks/agent-doc/plan-queue-dedup-destroys-intentional-duplicates.md; relates review #queue-edit-lost-during-finalize-crdt, #queue-user-edit-overwrite.
9. [ ] [#clear-blocked-by-own-drafted-clear-command] #agent-doc-bug 2026-06-06: `agent-doc session clear <FILE>` is refused because the pane composer holds protected "drafted prompt input" whose tail IS the clear command itself (reason=drafted prompt input, current_command=agent-doc, tail="❯ agent-doc session clear ..."). The guard is self-defeating: the only drafted line blocking the clear is the clear command the operator just typed. Fix: exclude agent-doc control commands (session clear/interrupt-clear/stop) from the protected-prompt set so clear proceeds; keep protecting genuine drafted prompt content. Immediate recovery exists: `agent-doc session interrupt-clear <FILE>`. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-session-clear-blocked-by-own-drafted-command.md
10. [ ] [#tmux-status-turn-in-progress] #agent-doc-bug 2026-06-06: tmux status line is blank while a managed turn is active; should show "agent-doc: turn in progress" when the actor is busy and clear back to idle on ready. Drive it from the supervisor busy<->ready transitions (transition_actor_state + the new idle-queue-watch stale-busy self-heal) so the indicator never diverges from actor state. Overlaps #claude-busy-status-during-active-turn, #jb-stale-busy-idle-footer. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-tmux-status-turn-in-progress.md
11. [ ] [#stale-busy-self-heal-live-verify] [recommended] #agent-doc-bug live-verify the idle-queue-watch stale-busy self-heal (7b60fcdc): drive a managed Codex auto-loop into the wedge (auto_trigger_inject recursive agent-doc -> recursion-guard abandon -> actor left busy over idle composer), then confirm the supervisor logs idle_queue_watch_stale_busy_reconciled within ~2s and the queue resumes draining with no pane kill and no session status/clear. Could not repro the exact prompt-redraw-split wedge non-disruptively this cycle.
12. [ ] [#ipc-listener-dewedge-direct-disk] #agent-doc-bug detect a wedged/slow IPC listener (repeated 2s ack timeouts) and move the doc to direct-disk writes for the rest of the session so it cannot apply patches minutes late. Relates to the hung-write stale-live-buffer family. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-late-ipc-patch-duplicate-stalls-queue.md
13. [/] [#jb-run-preempt-followups] #agent-doc-bug follow-ups from plan-jb-run-preempt-autoloop-priority.md (sub-parts 2-4, head-insert shipped 79e0406d): (2) empty-queue autoloop suppression — overlaps #post-clear-auto-queue-suppress; (3) 60s busy ready-wait stall audit when a queue fallback exists; (4) recursion-guard escape hatch for a wedged loop ('recursive direct invocation would deadlock' blocking the one Run Agent Doc that could break the stall) — overlaps #autoloop-command-preemption. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-jb-run-preempt-autoloop-priority.md
14. [ ] [#jb-busy-active-turn-stall-live-verify] [recommended] live-verify #jb-run-agent-doc-busy-active-turn-stall end-to-end: with prompt-bearing drift present in a doc whose Codex pane is mid-turn, click JB Run Agent Doc and confirm the session-still-running notification fires IMMEDIATELY (logs route_dispatch_only_busy_active_turn_skip_wait) instead of after a 60s stall. Deterministic core shipped b93b3c3c (skip busy ready-wait on proven active-turn busy_proof_line); could not repro the exact prompt-drift-while-busy path non-disruptively on the live monsterrodholders pane this session.
15. [ ] [#adoc-route-busy-fix-superproject-pointer-push] superproject main pointer push for the #jb-run-agent-doc-busy-active-turn-stall fix is DEFERRED (local commit 13600139e): pull --rebase conflicts on src/boost-client submodule pointer (concurrent-session shared-checkout divergence). Submodule fix b93b3c3c is pushed to origin/20260422/codex-agent-backend; land the superproject pointer on a clean cycle once boost-client divergence resolves.
16. [ ] [#test-submodule-worktree-git-identity] #agent-doc-bug: agent-doc tests that git-commit inside a checked-out submodule worktree (super/.git/modules/<sub>) don't set user.email/user.name there, so they pass locally (dev has global identity) but fail CI exit-128 — a green-local/red-CI flake. Fix at the test level: set the two config lines in the submodule worktree before the commit. Live example: flow::closeout::tests::classify_recovery_nested_parent_pointer_stale_when_submodule_ahead_of_parent (closeout.rs ~1383). Same class as the codex_final_gate test-bin-PATH flake fixed this session (0f7607a2). Replaces the deleted feedback_submodule_worktree_test_git_identity memory workaround.
17. [ ] [#multi-session-shared-build-isolation] #agent-doc-bug: the multi-session model lets a concurrent session's untracked/uncommitted work break the shared src/agent-doc crate build, forcing an isolated git-worktree-inside-src verification dance to ship a fix (committed+CI-green but not live until the other session compiles). Consider session-isolated build/worktree isolation so concurrent agent-doc sessions don't block each other's build/install. Replaces the deleted feedback_verify_via_worktree_inside_src memory workaround.
18. [ ] [#sync-fast-pane-hotpath] #agent-doc-bug: editor file-switch sync blocks because the fast pane-focus (safe_passive_focus_actor_after_sync_lock, sync.rs:467) runs AFTER the sync lock (SYNC_LOCK_WAIT_BUDGET 3s) + stacked reconcile budgets (router 1s, ownership proof 750ms, prune 1s). The claiming pane is usually already known (cheap cached read) but showing it is serialized behind lock contention + heavy reconcile. Fix: pre-lock fast pane resolution from the lock-free local projection + select_pane immediately (≤300ms target), create-on-miss without blocking, defer prune/router/ownership-proof/repair to a background reconcile, and make the fast select idempotent with the reconciler's final placement (race-safe; the lock guards concurrent stash/swap). Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-sync-pipeline-fast-pane-hotpath.md
19. [ ] [#queue-dedup-destroys-intentional-duplicates] #agent-doc-bug: queue dedup destroys intentional duplicate prompts. dedup_live_prompts (queue.rs:631, run every preflight at preflight.rs:3562) collapses all same-text live prompts, assuming duplicates are always IPC-drift merge artifacts — but users legitimately queue a command twice (user's two `- deploy` items; the 2nd was dropped mid-run). At preflight, user-added vs merge-created duplicates are structurally identical (provenance lost); snapshot-count / adjacency / 3+-copy heuristics all fail the uncommitted-2nd-deploy case. Fix at the merge source (provenance-aware) or gate dedup on a proven IPC-drift state — do NOT delete dedup (reintroduces #adoc-queue-ipc-drift growth).
