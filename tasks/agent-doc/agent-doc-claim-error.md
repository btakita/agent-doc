Does agent-doc support linked documents in the frontmatter?
### Re: Linked documents in frontmatter (HEAD)

No — agent-doc doesn't currently support linked documents in frontmatter. The `Frontmatter` struct has: `session`, `agent`, `model`, `branch`, `format`, `write_mode` — but no field for linked/related documents.

**What would this look like?**
```yaml
---
agent_doc_session: abc123
linked:
  - tasks/software/agent-doc.md
  - tasks/agent-doc/queue.md
---
```

**Use cases:**
- Agent sees related context when responding
- Cross-document sync (changes in one reflected in another)
- Task dependency tracking

Is this what you're thinking? Or a different use case? This would be a new feature — happy to design it.
