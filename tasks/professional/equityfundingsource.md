### Re: Please create sample borrower documents and sample investor documents that I can upload for testing. Place in the equityfundingsource-dev/tmp directory. Ensure tmp is in .gitignore. — gpt-5

> Please create sample borrower documents and sample investor documents that I can upload for testing. Place in the equityfundingsource-dev/tmp directory. Ensure tmp is in .gitignore.

Created local sample upload fixtures under `src/equityfundingsource-dev/tmp/` for testing.

Borrower samples:
- `tmp/borrower/borrower-appraisal-report.pdf`
- `tmp/borrower/borrower-bank-statement.csv`
- `tmp/borrower/borrower-entity-authorization.txt`
- `tmp/borrower/borrower-payoff-statement.txt`

Investor samples:
- `tmp/investor/investor-accreditation-letter.pdf`
- `tmp/investor/investor-bank-statement.csv`
- `tmp/investor/investor-tax-k1-summary.csv`
- `tmp/investor/investor-entity-formation.txt`
- `tmp/investor/investor-wire-instructions.txt`

I also added `tmp/README.md` describing the fixture set. `src/equityfundingsource-dev/.gitignore` already contains `tmp/`, and I verified Git ignores the new fixture files. I checked MIME detection: the PDFs report as `application/pdf`, the CSV files as `text/csv`, and the text files as `text/plain`, which are accepted by the app upload guard.

### Re: Why were the emails from the admin pipeline cards removed? Readd the emails. — gpt-5

> Why were the emails from the admin pipeline cards removed? Readd the emails.

The emails were dropped as an accidental regression during the admin Deal Pipeline card reshaping. The pipeline now has three card shapes — loan, prequalification lead, and incomplete full application — and the compact card UI diverged while adding the incomplete-application funnel. The loan card no longer consistently rendered `borrower_email`, and the lead/application card paths needed their own `email` display.

The current EFS working tree restores those fields:

- Loan cards carry and render `borrower_email`.
- Lead cards carry and render `email`.
- Incomplete full application cards carry and render `email`.
- Pipeline search includes both `borrower_email` and `email`.
- The application-card detail modal also shows the email.

Relevant paths:
- `src/equityfundingsource-dev/app/equityfundingsource/lib/admin/repo.ts`
- `src/equityfundingsource-dev/app/equityfundingsource/lib/admin/loan_management/index.ts`
- `src/equityfundingsource-dev/app/equityfundingsource/lib/admin/dashboard/index.ts`
- `src/equityfundingsource-dev/lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/admin/pipeline.tsx`
- `src/equityfundingsource-dev/tests/admin-pipeline.test.ts`
- `src/equityfundingsource-dev/tests/admin-dashboard.test.ts`

Verification:
- `bun test tests/admin-pipeline.test.ts tests/admin-dashboard.test.ts` passed: 64 tests.
- `make check` passed: 565 tests plus browser and worker builds.
- `gh run list --workflow CI --limit 1` could not find a workflow named `CI` in this submodule, so local verification is the available proof.

No actionable follow-up items remain for this queue head.

Escalation: no escalated shell permissions were needed. Confidence: high.

Is there an admin for the borrower portal messages? Can we have an email notification whenever a borrow sends a message? Can we support an email response back into the chat? Can the borrower receive emails whenever an admin responds with a message?

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#vd8s] [recommended] Investor Pipeline phase 2 — remaining after stalled-stage highlighting shipped (EFS 055a73c): drag-to-confirm-wire from the Committed lane (needs multi-pending-fund disambiguation) and TMO AddLoanFunding sync state in the Active lane once the writeback gate (#dzmm/#k2xg) clears. Per-investor activity timeline folds into the #vtx8 detail modal. Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/investor-pipeline-admin.md
- [/] [#67v2] Admin loan pipeline: TMO-aligned stages + Kanban (drag cards, auto-advance when stage requirements met) synced to dashboard; mirror TMO stages as single source of truth. From 2026-06-03 call. Relates to #dzmm/#k2xg.
- [/] [#zwws] [recommended] Investor dashboard rework — remaining phases are externally gated: 4 vestings/special-instructions (TMO writeback-gated #dzmm/#k2xg/#7a4d); 6 new-deal email + workflow-priority dashboard (#f4rq). Shipped: P1 nav (30037e3), P2 dashboard-composite landing (3e06907), P2b interest-button + distributions/statements cleanup (efs cd4253a), P3 simplified portfolio (8d40c66), P5 accreditation→annual Requirements (efs 1957f64). Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/rpzm-investor-dashboard-rework.md. Queue one phase at a time.
- [/] [#xcvg] [recommended] Borrower message email round-trip: add an admin owner for borrower-portal secure messages, email notification when a borrower sends a message, inbound email reply that appends into the D1 chat, and borrower email when an admin replies. Builds on existing chat_sessions/chat_messages. Gated on Resend EFS sending domain (f4rq) + Google Workspace SMTP (m6ch/p40t).
- [/] [#next-steps] Remaining EFS workers.dev production state: D1 API token unblocked; migrations 0025/0026 are already applied; Cloudflare Access env vars are deployed for /login/access-callback on workers.dev using the one-time PIN IdP. Custom domain cutover remains intentionally deferred; true Google Workspace SSO remains gated on Google admin credentials.
- [/] [#37ah] [recommended] Broker portal backend: replace static broker demo data with TMO-backed submit-deal, pipeline, commissions, documents, and notifications
- [/] [#dzmm] TMO webhooks: confirm outbound webhook support (Robert to check with Mortgage Office)
- [/] [#qakx] Investor portal document pages: replace static Documents, Statements, and Accreditation fixture data with D1/R2-backed APIs and authenticated upload/request/download flows.
- [/] [#1v5m] Resolved 2026-05-25: created an EFS-specific Cloudflare API token scoped to account 1e7e194ff8da4ad9e40ce041aea84f76 with D1, Workers Scripts, R2, observability, and read-only user/account metadata permissions; updated passage btak/equityfundingsource/cloudflare_api_token. D1 migration list/apply now succeeds and reports no pending migrations.
- [/] [#jnzs] [recommended] Await Judith or EFS reviewer approval on funded-deal images, copy, lien-position wording, and legal/disclosure language before invoicing or launch sign-off. Technical D1 migration, Worker deploy, and live funded-deals/admin-route smoke tests completed 2026-05-23.
- [/] [#dropbox-sync-adapter] Dropbox sync adapter: after Dropbox access is available, push/pull R2_DOCUMENTS with idempotent retries, backfill, tombstone handling, and per-document sync logs.

## Completed / Reaped

<!-- agent:icebox -->
- [ ] [#e1kb] Point equityfundingsource.com and www.equityfundingsource.com at the Cloudflare Pages project equityfundingsource, then verify / and /funded-deals on the custom domain; if admin routes are expected on the custom domain too, decide whether to route those paths to the Worker or move the dynamic app fully behind the same hostname.
- [ ] [#z3kx] GoHighLevel CRM as messaging/notifications path of record (Robert's enterprise GHL); integrate with the site so notifications also surface in-app; avoid SendGrid/extra recurring fees. From 2026-06-03 call. Relates to #xcvg.
