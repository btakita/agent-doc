# Corky Public Google App

Publish a verified Google OAuth app for corky so users don't need to create their own credentials.

## Requirements

- Register corky as a Google OAuth app
- Request `gmail.readonly` scope (requires Google security review)
- Publish privacy policy and terms of service
- Domain verification for `corky` brand
- Ship default client credentials in corky binary (or fetch from a config endpoint)
- Users opt in by setting `provider = "gmail-api"` without `[gmail]` credentials — falls back to published app

## Notes

- Self-hosted credentials remain the default (no trust dependency)
- Published app is an optional convenience for users who don't want to create their own GCP project
- Google security review for `gmail.readonly` can take weeks

Does Google Compute Cloud have the equivalent of AWS CDK?
Can we create a config file that syncs a Google Compute Cloud app?
