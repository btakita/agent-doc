❯ Create an addendum document with my public github projects. Include projects created after April 6. Include a line for my private projects.
### Re: SignRequest — Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement — opus-4-7

Loaded the document via chromium-bridge ("052826 Dreamable - Brian Takita Settlement and Mutual Release Agreement.pdf", sent by rob@dreamable.com, dated May 28, 2026, already counter-signed by Rob).

**Structure**

- Parties: Dreamable, Inc. (846A North Point St., SF) and Brian Takita (PO Box 571 / 1 Park St., North Grosvenordale, CT).
- Recitals: Consulting Agreement + Addendum effective April 5, 2026. Services rendered through May 26, 2026. April 6, 2026 email terminated the Consulting Agreement; engagement continued under the same terms except for a payment-amount modification.
- 12 terms + signatures.

**Terms summary**

1. **Engagement Period** — April 6, 2026 → May 26, 2026.
2. **Settlement Payment** — $5,000 as "full and final settlement … all compensation obligations satisfied in full."
3. **Intellectual Property** — Broad assignment: all inventions, code, documentation, and work product developed *for* Company *or in connection with the Services* during the engagement is Company property. Catch-all assignment at the end of the section sweeps anything not already covered by a prior written assignment.
4. **Prior Inventions** — Confirms Consultant retains exclusive ownership of all Prior Inventions listed *in the Addendum*. Company gets a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to anything Consultant's OSS pulled into Company products under the published OSS license terms.
5. **Confidentiality** — Standard, survives termination.
6. **Company Property** — All documents/code/materials created or received in connection with Services are Company property; no use or disclosure post-engagement.
7. **Mutual Release** — Full mutual release of all claims arising out of the engagement, with explicit California Civil Code §1542 waiver (you give up unknown claims too).
8. **Non-Disparagement** — Symmetric; truthful legal testimony preserved.
9. **Patent/Copyright Assistance** — Consultant assists Company in securing rights to the inventions described in Section 3. Survives termination.
10. **Governing Law / Arbitration** — California law; JAMS arbitration in San Francisco County; each side bears own fees + equal arbitration costs.
11. **Entire Agreement** — Supersedes prior agreements *except* the April 5, 2026 Consulting Agreement, the Addendum thereto, and any subsequent agreements/termination notices including the April 6, 2026 termination notice.
12. **Severability** — Standard.

**Things to weigh before signing**

1. **$5,000 vs. expected fees.** At the original $4,000/week rate, April 6 → May 26 is ~7 weeks ≈ $28k. If you've already been paid the bulk of that and $5k is a true tail-end settlement, fine. If $5k is the *total* you'll have received for the engagement period, the gap is large and worth resolving before signing — the §7 mutual release with §1542 waiver extinguishes any future unpaid-wages claim.
2. **Section 3 is broad.** "In connection with the Services" can be read aggressively. The Addendum's §2(b) open-source carve-out survives via §11, but Section 3 here does not re-cite or reaffirm it. Two clean ways to firm this up:
   - Add a sentence to Section 3: *"For avoidance of doubt, Section 3 does not modify the carve-outs in §2 of the Addendum, including the open-source carve-out at §2(b)."*
   - Or attach the engagement-period-projects addendum (see below) as Exhibit A-1 so the parties have a contemporaneous record of which works fall under §2(b).
3. **Section 4 only references Prior Inventions** as of the Addendum's Effective Date. The Addendum's §2(b) categorically covers *future* OSS too, but the Settlement does not echo that. The supplemental addendum I drafted below makes the application explicit for the April 6 – May 26 window.
4. **§1542 waiver in §7** is standard but irreversible — it covers claims you don't know about yet (e.g., later-surfacing wage-and-hour, retaliation, or IP-misappropriation claims). Only sign once the §5,000 number, the IP boundary, and any other known issues are resolved to your satisfaction.
5. **JAMS in San Francisco County** is a venue burden for a CT-based consultant. Probably not worth re-negotiating, but it's a meaningful cost if a dispute ever arose.
6. **Non-disparagement (§8)** is symmetric — fine. Just be aware it constrains what you can say publicly about the engagement.

**Bottom line.** The structure is reasonable for a closeout, and §11 preserves the Addendum (including the open-source carve-out). The two items I'd want resolved before signing: (a) the $5k settlement amount versus actual outstanding fees, and (b) explicit reaffirmation of the §2(b) open-source carve-out so Section 3's broad assignment can't be re-read against it later.

### Re: Engagement-period projects addendum — opus-4-7

Drafted at [`tasks/dreamable/addendum-engagement-period-projects.md`](addendum-engagement-period-projects.md). It supplements the original Addendum's Exhibit A by enumerating what was created during the April 6 → May 26 engagement window, and points to Addendum §2(b) and Settlement §4 as the controlling carve-outs.

**Public repositories (github.com/btakita), created after April 6, 2026:**

| Repository | Created | License | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [tsift](https://github.com/btakita/tsift) | 2026-04-17 | MIT | Token-efficient CLI plugin for Claude Code — Sift-powered search + native tool routing |
| [homebrew-tap](https://github.com/btakita/homebrew-tap) | 2026-05-05 | tap metadata (no proprietary content) | Homebrew tap for your CLI tools |

**Private repositories:** the document includes a single summary line covering the 3 private repos created during the window (`session-share`, `boost-client`, `monsterrodholders-dev` — described categorically, not enumerated, consistent with the original Exhibit A's blanket clause for private repos).

**Suggested use.** Two options:

1. **Attach to the Settlement** as "Exhibit A-1" before signing. Email it to Rob with a one-line note: "Adding a supplement to the Addendum's Exhibit A to cover work created during the engagement window. Identical legal effect under Addendum §2(b)."
2. **Keep on file** as your own contemporaneous record if you'd rather not re-open the document with Rob. The Addendum's §2(b) carve-out already protects the public OSS projects categorically; this just removes ambiguity if it's ever questioned.

I'd lean toward option 1 — five minutes of friction now prevents an IP-claim gray area later, and it's consistent with how the original Addendum framed Prior Inventions.

### Re: Uploadable document + post-signing protection — opus-4-7

**PDF for SignRequest upload**

Generated `tasks/dreamable/addendum-engagement-period-projects.pdf` (via pandoc + weasyprint) from the existing markdown addendum. Upload it as an attachment in SignRequest via the *Attachments* (paperclip) button next to *Finalize*. SignRequest stores attachments alongside the signed PDF in the completed-document bundle.

If you'd prefer a tighter, signature-page-style format (single block of text, no markdown table), say so and I'll re-render. The current version mirrors the language from the original Addendum so it reads as a continuation, not a separate instrument.

**Are projects created after signing protected?**

Yes — fully. New work you create after May 26, 2026 (the close of the Engagement Period defined in Settlement §1) is outside the scope of every IP clause in the Settlement Agreement and the Consulting Agreement:

- **Settlement §3 (Intellectual Property)** only assigns inventions "developed for Company or in connection with the Services *during the engagement*." Post-engagement work is not covered.
- **Settlement §6 (Company Property)** only reaches materials "created or received in connection with the Services" — same engagement-scope.
- **Settlement §4 (Prior Inventions)** is preserved; doesn't apply to new work either way.
- **Addendum §2(b)** (general-purpose OSS carve-out) is preserved by Settlement §11 — though it's largely moot post-engagement since you're no longer assigning *anything*.

What does survive past signing:

| Clause | What it constrains | Practical limit |
|---|---|---|
| Settlement §5 — Confidentiality | Use/disclosure of Dreamable non-public info (trade secrets, product plans, customers, financials, personnel) | Don't reuse Dreamable internals in new work. Independently developed code/ideas are unaffected. |
| Settlement §8 — Non-disparagement | Disparaging statements about Dreamable to third parties | Doesn't restrict your work, only your speech about Dreamable. Truthful legal testimony is preserved. |
| Settlement §9 — Patent/Copyright Assistance | Reasonable cooperation to secure Company rights in §3 Inventions | Limited to the *past* engagement's work product — not new projects. |
| Consulting Agreement non-compete (if any) | Worth re-checking the original Consulting Agreement | Settlement §11 keeps it alive. If there's a post-termination non-compete window, it still runs from May 26 for the stated duration. |

**One thing to check before signing.** Re-read the original Consulting Agreement (§6, §7, and any "Restrictive Covenants" / "Non-Solicitation" section) for any post-termination restrictions on competing work or soliciting Dreamable's customers/employees. The Settlement preserves the Consulting Agreement by reference in §11, so any post-termination clauses there still apply. The Settlement itself doesn't add new post-signing restrictions on your work — just confidentiality and non-disparagement.

**Bottom line.** Once signed, you're free to build whatever you want — open-source, private, commercial, competing tools — provided you (a) don't reuse Dreamable confidential information and (b) don't make disparaging statements about Dreamable. Existing carve-outs from the Addendum continue to apply, and §3's broad assignment language is contained to the April 6 – May 26 window.

### Re: Payment delay and contract effectiveness — opus-4-7

**Short answer.** Yes — the Settlement is in effect from the moment both parties sign. Payment is Dreamable's *contractual obligation under* the agreement, not a *condition precedent to* the agreement. A significant payment delay is a breach by Dreamable; it does not, by itself, suspend or void the agreement. That asymmetry matters, because the §7 mutual release (with the §1542 waiver) extinguishes your claims on execution, while you only get a contract claim for the $5,000 in return.

**What "in effect" means here**

- **Mutual Release (§7)** — operative on execution. Once both signatures are on the document, you have released all claims arising out of the engagement, including any unpaid-wages claim that might otherwise have exceeded $5k.
- **IP assignment (§3)** — operative on execution. The engagement-period work product is Company property whether or not Rob pays.
- **Confidentiality (§5) and Non-Disparagement (§8)** — operative on execution and surviving.
- **Payment (§2)** — Dreamable's contractual *obligation*. Settlement agreements typically don't condition the release on actual receipt of payment unless that's drafted in explicitly. Without a "payment is a condition precedent" clause, the release fires first.

**What you can do if Rob delays significantly**

1. **Send a demand letter** citing §2. Reasonable cure window (10–14 days is typical), referencing the agreement section and the executed signature page.
2. **Initiate JAMS arbitration in San Francisco County** per §10. For a $5,000 claim this is wildly disproportionate — JAMS filing fees alone start around $1,750, and §10 makes each side bear their own attorneys' fees with equal split on arbitrator costs. Practically, the arbitration clause makes a $5k breach uneconomic to pursue formally.
3. **Small-claims alternative** — California small-claims caps at $12,500 for individuals, but §10's arbitration clause likely forecloses that route. Worth asking a CA-licensed attorney whether the arbitration clause is enforceable for amounts below a certain threshold (some states carve out small-dollar claims).
4. **Rescission** is theoretically available for material breach, but courts are reluctant to rescind a fully-executed mutual release. Don't count on it.

**Mitigations to consider before signing**

The cleanest fix is to make payment a condition precedent or use simultaneous exchange:

- **Option A — Payment on or before signing.** "Settlement Payment shall be made by wire transfer to Consultant on or before the Effective Date. This Agreement shall not become effective until such payment is received." One-line edit; Rob either wires the $5k or you don't sign.
- **Option B — Escrow.** Funds in escrow released to you on counter-signature. More friction, used when trust is low.
- **Option C — Payment-conditional release.** "The releases in Section 7 are expressly conditioned on Consultant's receipt of the Settlement Payment. If the Settlement Payment is not received within [N] days of the Effective Date, the releases shall be null and void *ab initio*." Preserves your unpaid-wages claim if Rob stiffs you.
- **Option D — Liquidated damages / interest.** "Any portion of the Settlement Payment not paid within [N] days of the Effective Date shall accrue interest at the maximum rate permitted by California law and Company shall reimburse Consultant for any collection costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees." Doesn't fix the asymmetry but raises the cost of delay and gives you fee-shifting that §10 otherwise removes.

**Recommendation.** Given the JAMS-in-SF venue + each-side-pays-own-fees structure, the $5k is effectively unenforceable through the contract's own dispute mechanism if Rob delays. Insist on **Option A** (payment on or before signing). It's a one-line edit, it costs Rob nothing if he intends to pay, and it removes the asymmetry entirely. If he resists Option A, fall back to **Option C** so you retain leverage.

**Not legal advice.** This is a structural read of the document. Before signing or making changes, run the options past a CA-licensed employment/contracts attorney — at minimum a 30-minute paid consult. The §1542 waiver alone is worth that fee.
