## Queue: Issues
<!-- agent:queue id=issues loop interval=1h -->
- Watch https://github.com/btakita/agent-doc/issues for new issues. Add new issues into the backlog + queue except issue #40 + #45.
<!-- /agent:queue -->

## Todo
<!-- agent:todo -->
- [ ] [#ahfe] Live-check GH #267 on the 263 IDE: after `agent-doc upgrade` WITHOUT restart, once idea.log shows `[native] hot-reloaded libagent_doc`, Run Agent Doc should complete (ops.log `editor_route_superseded_editor_admitted`, route output ends with the advisory line). 2026-10-15 operator: did not work (believed); watch for bug reports before reopening GH #267.
- [ ] [#ctg7] Under heavy load, switch the editor 2 panes -> 1 -> 2 and confirm tmux follows and stays at 2 (stale-controller fix).
<!-- /agent:todo -->

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog priority queue -->
- [/] [#gh299-live-263-proof] Live-verify v0.35.519 on JetBrains 263.7031 with changed plugin sources: `agent-doc upgrade` must hot-reload and complete without an IDE restart; close GH #299 only with that proof.
<!-- /agent:backlog -->

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#jb262dynlauncherrecommen] [recommended] [operator-verify] [agent-doc] Operator decision: jb262dynupgrade (153c72916) chose the accurate-warning option (a 262 package reports declined_by=modular_package and falls back to file replacement + restart). Either keep that as the supported policy (then close this), or authorize a real restart-free launcher for the exact-262 split-mode plugin that swaps backend + frontend (the frontend may run in a separate JetBrains Client process), proven against a live 262 IDE.
- [/] [#pypiquotarecheck] Track pypi/support#12214 (agent-doc project limit request, 25 GiB) to a decision. Unblocked mechanically by a human reply on pypi/support#12214, or make pypi-quota-check reporting a ceiling in reach. Rechecked 2026-10-12: pre-cutover 131 releases 8.361 GiB (0.35.113..0.35.343), post-cutover 91 releases 3.19 MiB (mean 35.9 KiB), about 47,722 further releases fit; VERDICT headroom fine. The support issue is still open with one comment, unchanged since 2026-09-10. Nothing to act on or delete. If the grant lands, record it and drop this item; deletion stays reserved for a ceiling the authenticated check reports.

<!-- agent:icebox -->
- [ ] [#ghrecvpolicy] [agent-doc] Recipient-side [receive] auto_create_components policy for multi-user workspaces (GH #40, https://github.com/btakita/agent-doc/issues/40). Parked until multi-user workspace support exists.
