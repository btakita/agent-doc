### Re: #cmgrwres — gpt-5

I could not start implementation for `#cmgrwres` because `agent-doc plan` stopped on a blocker before repo work. The blocker was the tsift graph-evidence phase timing out while running `tsift conflict-matrix --path /home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/tasks/software/tsift.md --json cmgrwres`.

No spec, test, build, install, commit, or push work was performed in this cycle. `#cmgrwres` remains open because the execution contract failed closed before code changes were authorized.

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog -->
- [ ] [#tsdag] [recommended] Add graph-level dependency DAG extraction for agent-doc work: derive explicit and implicit edges among backlog ids from file/symbol/test/config overlap, semantic relations, worker_result follow-up ids, and depends-on text; emit nodes, edges, cycle diagnostics, topo batches, replay commands, and repair commands as a versioned JSON contract.
- [ ] [#impactdag] [recommended] Extend conflict-matrix and dispatch-trace with scheduler fields: parallel_safe, blocks, blocked_by, required_context, expected_tests, and stable graph handles so agent-doc can run topological antichains without scraping prose.
- [ ] [#dagfix] [recommended] Add regeneration fixtures for real agent-doc queue DAGs: refresh -> evidence -> conflict-matrix -> dependency-dag -> dispatch-trace, asserting projection freshness, packet ids, worker_result closure, cycle detection, and stale graph fail-closed behavior.
- [ ] [#dbbench] [recommended] Add an experimental GraphStore backend evaluation for DuckDB/DuckPGQ and Ladybug: prototype read-only adapters behind the existing contract, benchmark refresh/status/evidence/conflict-matrix/dispatch-trace on real and synthetic projections, and only promote if it beats SQLite without worsening multi-process lock behavior or install portability.
- [/] [#orchdog] [recommended] Dogfood the completed graph-backed agent orchestration stack on a real agent-doc queue run: run refresh -> evidence -> conflict-matrix -> dispatch-trace -> jobs create/collect, compare worker_prompt_packet and worker_result closure fields, and capture any tsift-side fixture gaps. **Dogfood performed 2026-05-21 on `session-share/tasks/root.md` items #x63e + #v4v0; findings recorded in #gdbevid, #cmgr, #gdbidx — see `session-share/tasks/root.md` exchange "graph-backed orchestration dogfood" entry for the full pipeline trace.** **Second dogfood 2026-05-21 against `tasks/software/tsift.md` (preset `#dogfood-tsift`) surfaced 2 new gaps: #cmgrwres and #gdblock.**
