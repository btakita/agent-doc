## Queue

<!-- agent:queue priority preset="#spec-test-build-install-commit-push" priority go -->
- :pushpin: Both JB `Clear Session Context` and JB `Run Agent Doc` send a CR instead of submitting ![img_24.png](img_24.png). There is also an extra prompt that bleeds into the input ![img_25.png](img_25.png). Why is this so difficult to fix? Can we design a way to detect what is sent and how it is processed by the agent? Fix root causes. #simworld
- :pushpin: Why are we ever using `tmux_literal_cr` and not `tmux_literal_text_enter_key`? Why do we have so much duplicate logic with the submit keys all over the codebase? Each harness' tmux_literal should be defined in a single place. No tmux_literal values spread all over the place. Why tmux_literal_kitty_return for opencode? Is tmux_literal_text_enter_key not working? #simworld
- :pushpin: Does agent-doc use `tmux send-keys -t target "command" Enter` to submit a prompt? Would this work with opencode? I don't want to hardcode a kitty return b/c kitty is specific to my environment...not universal. I'm concerned that it wont work on other terminals. I tried `tmux send-keys -t .1 "Hello" Enter` on opencode and it worked.
- :pushpin: Can we use lazily-rs to avoid duplicate logic with the submit keys all over the codebase?
- :pushpin: Issue with restart on Codex ![img_26.png](img_26.png) ![screenshot.png](../../../../../Pictures/agent-loop/screenshot.png)
- :pushpin: Complete the `[operator-verify]` and live verification using the logs to prove/disprove the intended behavior.
<!-- /agent:queue -->
###
<!--
Please make backlog replacements for all gated review items. We need to complete the plan, not have any more gates after this round. Let me know when I need to install JB plugin updates. Make sure all JB live gate items have adequate logging to prove/disprove the item. Clear the review items. I will test, files bugs, and you will check the logs.

`'/clear' is disabled while a task is in progress
---~~~~
A recent monsterrodholders.md session had much churn after I edited the queue while a turn was running. One churn item included deleting a queue item that I added.
---
agent-doc reentrant run on equityfundingsource.md had recovery churn.
```
● The recovery is complete and fully consistent. The binary converged the now-drained queue (empty block, queue_active:
  false), no_changes: true, both responses are committed in the session doc, and both code deliverables are on
  origin/main. The auto-loop terminated naturally.

  Let me record the specific recovery path for this failure mode, since it's a recurring dogfooding pattern
```

- This session's console stdout is bleeding in front of the opencode tui. ![img_16.png](img_16.png)
---
The last run had a code fence stripped away by agent-doc.

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog priority queue -->
- [ ] [#lazilyqrestore] [operator-verify] Restore/account for lost queue content in `tasks/software/lazily-rs.md`: that document is foreign-owned by another pane, so capture the intended lost queue heads from the owning lazily-rs session/doc history/snapshots/sidecars, restore them as backlog items there, or record explicit user-removal proof. Related #queue-clear-unrun-items/#manual-queue-head-loss/#queue-user-edit-overwrite.
- [ ] [#recyclerestart-verify] [operator-verify] #recyclerestart live proof + promotion: Q1 (recycle ENOENT / restart) + Q2 (FFI self-heal sync guard, supersede-newer-generation) are committed (agent-doc 0b31e90c, fa6a230a) but NOT promoted onto the live stale supervisor — the img_23 stall is the pre-fix binary. Recycle/restart the supervisor onto the new build (agent-doc admin recycle --all-projects, or restart), then confirm: kill-pane + JB Sync Tmux Layout no longer reports Sync deferred, and a real idle/next-queue recycle restarts/re-clears the agent session. Cannot be agent-done. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-pcp-recycle-no-restart-sync-block.md
- [ ] [#rtwbcast-verify] [operator-verify] rtwbcast rung 4 final proof — two-live-IDE CRDT broadcast convergence: with the installed build, edit the same managed doc in JB and VS Code at once and confirm both editor buffers receive the broadcast patch and converge (no clobber). Implementation landed agent-doc cddad87b (id/deliver/merge, SimWorld-covered, CI green). Cannot be agent-done — needs two live editors. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-realtime-editor-watcher.md
- [ ] [#c2b6] [operator-verify] compactdrift live JB Compact Exchange re-verify: with a freshly make-install-ed agent-doc (installed cdylib currently predates aafa6510), run JB Compact Exchange on a doc whose HEAD holds a finalized Re: response and confirm it compacts WITHOUT the "refusing to auto-adopt committed historical response patchback / out-of-band typed_component_drift" bail. Any persistent failure from a NON-wedged session files against stuckhandoff2, not here. Code complete + committed agent-doc bca26cfd; 108 commit_ tests green this cycle.
- [ ] [#1j8q] [operator-verify] #suprecyclelock live proof: drive a real next_queue_item supervisor self-recycle (go-mode queue drain over a freshly-installed binary) while a sibling/concurrent launcher holds the shared project-root controller-launch.lock; confirm the execve'd start no longer surfaces "controller launch already in progress ... (os error 11)" on the pane and ops.log shows the contended waiter adopting the published controller instead. Fixed in agent-doc-orchestration project_controller.rs LaunchLock::acquire_blocking + connect_or_launch.
- [ ] [#anw0verify] [operator-verify] #anw0 redirect live proof: install the new agent-doc binary (cargo build --release + cargo install + lib-install) then drive a real recycle / restart-supervisor race so a dispatcher holding a superseded generation hits the new path. Confirm ops.log shows dispatch_stale_generation_redirect prior_generation=N next_generation=N+1 then dispatch_retry_after_stale_generation and a clean re-dispatch (no terminal generation-N-is-closed). Code+SimWorld landed agent-doc 21a70cdd / superproject 412355fa3. Cannot be agent-done: needs a live editor + real recycle.
- [ ] [#qflood2] [operator-verify] qflood regression: JB Run Agent Doc on efs coalesced as exit-1 (dual-drain owner, gen 66 already in flight). Needs live multi-process verify; if it still collides, coalesce should report deduped-success not exit-1. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-queue-dispatch-flood.md
- [ ] [#qt32] [operator-verify] #lvbremain Operator live zero-drift PROOF of the 08b supervisor-in-process cutover (cannot be agent-done — needs a live editor). Restart a session, drive one edit-during-finalize cycle, agent reads ops.log for write_authority action=routed + plugin_watch_readonly + supervisor_host_gate hosting=in-process + ZERO drift lines. [recommended]
- [ ] [#fcc0-live-verify] [operator-verify] #fcc0 live JB 0-dialog proof: with the current agent-doc binary/cdylib installed and the route-owned supervisor recycled onto it, drive a live JetBrains queue/template/compact write path and confirm ops.log shows editor IPC convergence (for example queue_consume_writeback ... transport=editor_ipc) and zero JetBrains File Cache Conflict dialogs. Cannot be agent-done; requires live IDE observation.
