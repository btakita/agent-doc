### Session Summary

*Compacted. Content archived to `/home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/.agent-doc/archives/483039e7a9b103bd5b68223dac05a4c449ac03899aba53d6022e82100578b5b0-20260507-155421.md`*

Active backlog:
- [ ] [#noopcap] [recommended] Collapse repeated commit_noop closeout churn into a compact or restart handoff instead of appending another Re: section.
- [ ] [#chkptcap] Periodic checkpoint capture during response streaming — capture partial responses every 30s so mid-generation pane death does not lose work entirely.
- [ ] [#sqliterepros] [recommended] Before prototyping .agent-doc/state.db, capture 2-3 current agent-doc failures where cross-file authority drift or non-atomic state writes would have been fixed by one transactional store rather than by the single-owner actor/supervisor model alone.

[route] bare codex reopen for tasks/agent-doc/agent-doc-bugs2.md was accepted in pane %210, but no routed submission proof appeared after 10s — keeping the dispatch optimistic
Error: dispatch-only codex reopen for tasks/agent-doc/agent-doc-bugs2.md was accepted in pane %210 via direct_pane_submit (tmux_literal_enter_delayed), but Codex never recorded a routed submission proof after waiting 10s; the pane is live but not dispatch-ready enough to confirm the reopen. Restore an idle Codex prompt or restart the session and reroute again

Please optimize the AGENTS.md + SKILL.md to reduce context usage yet maintain effectiveness for Claude Code + Codex

Does the supervisor actor ever block on `Run Agent Doc`? I noticed that /home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/tasks/software/tsift did not respond to `Run Agent Doc` in a previous turn. It seems to run ok now but I'm concerned that `Run Agent Doc` was non-responsive.

- [ ] [#sqliteeval] [recommended] Review plan tasks/agent-doc/plan-sqlite-session-store-concurrency.md against the single-owner actor rollout and decide whether to prototype .agent-doc/state.db as the authoritative session store.
