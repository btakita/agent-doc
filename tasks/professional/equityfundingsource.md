### Re: Production deployment — gpt-5

Deployed synced `main` commit `94b1c681` to the isolated Cloudflare `[env.production]` environment.

- Production Worker version: `09a4545a-b2d3-46e2-acb9-bbba96453e54`.
- Verification: `make check` exited 0 (tests, application build, and Worker build); production D1 has no pending migrations and had a current Time Travel bookmark before deploy.
- Live smoke tests: `https://equityfundingsource.com/` and `https://www.equityfundingsource.com/` both return 200; the live HTML references the newly built `index.server-F3GIZVIS_OJV2QJEG.css` and `index.browser-KPCOEO5T.js` assets.
- The deployed version exposes the expected D1, R2, Durable Object, email, rate-limit, scheduled, and environment bindings.
- No application commit or push was needed: `94b1c681` was already committed, pushed, and synchronized with `origin/main`. Unrelated local `AGENTS.md` / `.agent/` changes were preserved untouched.

This was not a repeat of the older completed deployment: the previously active production version predated ten homepage commits now included in `94b1c681`.

> **Queue prompt:** Please provide an admin interface to edit + add + remove testimonials. Note that EFS will collect private testimonials from clients.

### Re: Testimonial administration — gpt-5

Implemented the authenticated testimonial manager at `/admin/testimonials` and committed it as EFS `2c4c63ef`.

- Admins can add, edit, order, publish, keep private, and permanently remove testimonials through new admin-only CRUD APIs.
- Newly collected client testimonials default to **Private — admins only**. Only an explicit **Public homepage** selection makes a record eligible for public rendering; if no public records remain, the homepage omits the testimonial section instead of exposing private or fallback content.
- D1 migration `0145_testimonials.sql` creates the privacy-aware data model and seeds the six existing approved Google/Yelp reviews as public records, preserving their order and complete copy.
- The homepage now reads public testimonials from D1, supports per-testimonial ratings and paragraphs, validates optional source URLs as HTTP(S), and HTML-escapes admin-authored content.
- Updated the lending-portal PRD and added regression coverage for migration seeding, private defaults, URL validation, escaped dynamic rendering, empty-public-set behavior, admin CRUD routes, and portal navigation.

Verification passed: the focused testimonial/homepage tests, full `make check`, `git diff --check`, and an in-memory SQLite application of migration `0145` (`public|6`). This repository currently exposes no GitHub Actions workflow runs to inspect. Pre-existing `AGENTS.md` and `.agent/` worktree changes were preserved and excluded from the feature commit.

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog priority queue -->
- [ ] [#qhh8] deploy to staging
<!-- /agent:backlog -->

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#censiblecorefollow] Rotate the FactSet FTP credential with FactSet, then update passage finegar/FACTSET_FTP_LOGIN and FACTSET_FTP_PASSWORD. Proven 2026-08-02: the 12-char login and 8-char password sitting in censible-core git history (5 commits, d19a6c0f 2022-06-10 through f839e701b 2026-03-14) are SHA-256 identical to what passage serves today, so the credential has never been rotated and the historical copy is live. FTS.Factset.com:21 is reachable and answers. The tracked working-tree file was NOT carrying a secret - it holds passage command substitutions since f839e701b. Rotation supersedes any history rewrite; rewriting is optional cleanup for a private repo and cannot un-disclose anything. Blocked on a FactSet account action.
- [/] [#tmo-sandbox-purge-apply] [operator-verify] Execute the sandbox purge only after explicit operator go. The auto-mirrored queue directive is not approval for permanent `DeleteLoan` operations. Before any approved purge, take the documented snapshot; preserve the existing 16-loan target list, keep-list, dry-run evidence, and warning that attachment bytes and RecIDs are not recoverable. Recipes: `docs/TMO/delete-loan.md`, `docs/TMO/snapshot.md`.
- [/] [#tmo-orphan-apply] [operator-verify] Apply the orphan reconcile plan: TMO_API_TOKEN="$(passage equityfundingsource/tmo/sandbox/api | head -1)" bun ./bin/tmo-orphan-reconcile.ts --remote --apply. Dry run re-verified 2026-07-18 against remote D1: reconcile_cache=12 + tombstone=6, push_funding=0, blocked_no_vesting=0, zero TMO writes (EFS-local only). CORRECTION 2026-07-18: this targets the STAGING database (equityfundingsource, 280e1539-b940-4c59-8988-fbed63c12ac0), NOT production — the earlier 'mutates PRODUCTION D1' note was wrong; --d1 defaults to the staging binding and production (293f0a4d) is untouched. TMO side is the sandbox database (001-8553-000-Equity Funding - Sandbox, sandbox=true). All 6 tombstone rows (TST217, TST254, TST374, TST723, TST762, TST999) verified inert: efs_id NULL, zero rows in loans.tmo_loan_number, zero rows in funds (funds is empty entirely). Operator confirmed 2026-07-18 that staging data is test data. Remaining gate is operator go only.
- [/] [#tmo-reconcile-auto] Automated reconciliation attempt over tmo_unmatched_fundings: for each unmatched TMO funding try RecID -> Account against lender_vestings.tmo_lender_account -> lender email, record confidence plus evidence, auto-bind above a threshold and queue the rest with the candidate ranking pre-computed. Per PRD D4 a bind reconciles EFS to TMO (TMO funding wins) and must record what it overrode. The matcher must be a pure function over pulled fundings + the lender/vesting roster so it is testable without TMO, mirroring vesting_gap_. Phase 3 of src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/vesting-and-tmo-reconciliation.md.
- [/] [#tmo-orphan-as-fundings] Replace #tmo-orphan-cache's tombstone plan per the operator directive: for each of the 18 orphan tmo_cache_entities 'loan' rows, reconcile against TMO if the loan exists, push the EFS-side funding into TMO via LOS.svc/AddLoanFunding (LOS-embed lender, PRD D1) and adopt the returned RecID if it does not, and tombstone only pure debris with no EFS deal. Gated on the EFS->TMO push gate (#dzmm/#7a4d). Phase 2 of src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/vesting-and-tmo-reconciliation.md.
- [/] [#tmo-prod-seat-not-provisioned] [operator-verify] The 2026-07-17 20:19 "Welcome to The Mortgage Office" credentials are for the SANDBOX host: the email's own Login link is https://app2.themortgageoffice.com/Login, not app.themortgageoffice.com (which is what the 2026-05-15 welcome email linked). So April's "added you to the production account" has not landed as a production seat yet — app2 still offers exactly one company, Equity Funding - Sandbox. Ask April to confirm which account/serial the new seat was created on and to provision app.themortgageoffice.com access. Credentials stored at passage equityfundingsource/tmo_login_2026_07_17.
- [/] [#mam7] Fractionalized loans (future): support up to ~10 lenders/loan with siloed per-lender info in the shared loan view. [followups: Fractionalized loans]
- [/] [#jzqj] Bidirectional TMO conditions sync (TMO as source of truth for conditions) + LOS lender-ID / deep-link into TMO pages. (gated on the Tue TMO screen-share + API access) [followups: TMO]
- [/] [#1067] Accreditation/suitability questionnaire: full form in the lender portal, income/net-worth options only, not a hard funding gate, admin-fillable, editable PDF + investigate DocuSign. Needs the DRE form + a DocuSign account. [followups: Accreditation]
- [/] [#nyc5] [P0] Available-deals upload: API endpoint + API key to upload investor offers to the marketplace (replaces manual YAMM) + a manual add-deal form (same template, admin-created). Needs Brian's offer-format spec. [followups: Available-deals]
- [/] [#tcb0] [P0] Go-live: publish the EFS site this week — disable/hide not-yet-functional portals, keep apply-for-loan + contact inquiries working; verify apply->TMO end-to-end. (needs operator go on which portals to hide) [followups: Go-live]
- [/] [#04v8] [recommended] Validate TMO cross-service lender visibility in a real TMO sandbox/tenant before relying on automated LOS funding writes: create or link a lender through `LSS.svc`, confirm `GetLender`, then attempt `LOS.svc` `AddLoanFunding`/`UpdateLoanFunding` on a test loan or get written TMO support confirmation that LOS funding resolves the LSS lender/vendor master `Account`.
- [/] [#apply-invite-fail-ux] Public `/apply` invite-failure UX: when the borrower invite email fails or is skipped after lead persistence, stop telling the borrower to check their inbox; show a received/follow-up message, keep the failed invite status visible to admins, and add a regression test.
- [/] [#email-bg-outbox] Durable email delivery observability/retry: record lifecycle, secure-message, broker, lending-group, investor-interest, login-link, invite, reminder, and feedback email results in D1 with status/error/retry/dead-letter instead of relying on console-only warnings for background notifications.
- [/] [#email-prod-ready] Email production-readiness hardening: provision a dedicated `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL_API_TOKEN` secret with Email Sending scope, verify `BROKER_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` if broker email is expected, add an admin/CI diagnostic that fails when production delivery would fall back to local capture, and document that `MESSAGE_EMAIL_INBOUND_SECRET` is only needed for the HTTP parsed-inbound route.
- [/] [#mcme] [recommended] #msg-read-status Email-open-based read receipts — DEFERRED: Cloudflare Email Sending has no open-tracking webhook, and transactional mail should stay on Cloudflare Email Sending. If email-open receipts become mandatory, design a Cloudflare-compatible tracking-pixel/event subsystem or accept portal-only read cursors. In-app portal read cursors already exist for borrower chat (`chat_sessions.*_last_read_at`) but are not email reads.
- [/] [#msg-unify4] [gated: awaiting dual-write prod soak] Lender cutover — dual-write (best-effort mirror into messages, both lender sources) + backfill (migration 0098) SHIPPED (EFS b5a6a55). Remaining: after soak, switch the inbox to read lender data from messages (dual-read), then drop deal_interest_lender_messages + lender_account_messages. Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/message-unification.md.
- [/] [#msg-unify3] [gated: awaiting dual-write prod soak] Borrower cutover — dual-write (best-effort mirror into messages) + backfill (migration 0097) SHIPPED (EFS 411a4da). Remaining: after the dual-write soaks live, switch the unified inbox to read borrower data from messages (dual-read), then drop chat_messages. Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/message-unification.md.
- [/] [#lender-card-msg-email] [recommended] Email-to-lender parity for #lender-card-msg account messages (mirror notify_lender_deal_message_): notify the lender by email when an admin posts an account message, like the deal-interest thread does. Rides the Cloudflare Email Sending / verified EFS sender gate (#f4rq). Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/lender-card-messaging.md.
- [/] [#proprate] Lender proposal persists a DEFAULT interest rate never finalized. investor/deal_detail.tsx:362 pre-fills proposal_rate from deal.monthly_interest when deal.proposal_interest_rate==null; submit (:425-435) sends it whenever an amount is present; :421 requires a finite rate, so a lender cannot commit an amount with rate TBD — the pre-filled default (6.5% on d6b78994) persists as if finalized. Duration NOT affected (no proposal_term_months column). DATA CLEANUP DONE 2026-06-20: nulled proposal_interest_rate on the d6b78994/b8ccaa76 row (kept proposal_amount=100000 + proposal_submitted_at; D1 changes=1). CODE FIX still pending operator go: do NOT pre-fill the rate with the deal default; allow proposal_interest_rate=null ("amount committed, rate TBD"); relax :421 validation + admin LoanTermProposalSummary display.
- [/] [#nthc] [operator-verify] DEPLOYED 2026-06-20 (worker version 17b06176-fc91-44b6-b35d-1cd61beed01b; EFS 8889a4c). Remaining = operator live-verify only: open the Lender Bros group Edit overlay on deal d6b78994, bump lender2 from 0%, confirm the split saves and the "60% confirmed (partial)" badge reconciles.
- [/] [#pmhf] [recommended] Reuse the rebalancing share editor (lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/shared/lending_groups_alloc.ts: rebalance_stakes_/distribute_evenly_/lock pins) in the per-deal split UI (deal_detail allocations) so per-deal % editing gets the same 100%-balanced, lockable inputs.
- [/] [#dealtab500] [operator-verify] Root-cause the deal 7a0c1463 / loan 45ddae53 (GQI751) loan-tab "Internal Error". Static trace independently re-confirmed exhausted: GET /admin/pipeline serves only a shell (no server-side deal processing); every client-fetched endpoint is guarded — admin_loan_R_ is a plain SELECT, admin_deal_R_ LTV/onboarding chain (onboarding_json_/loan_ltv_calc_) is fully try/catch + null guarded, /documents is harmless; all client fetches degrade to error cards, not the worker Internal Error page. Regression guard shipped (efs a39be3d) locking the thin-TMO-loan onboarding shape against throws (gformula deal-economics helpers). REMAINING (operator-gated, cannot be agent-done): reproduce live via `bun run cf:worker:tail` + a browser click on the loan tab to capture the real throwing endpoint + stack, OR inspect loan 45ddae53/deal 7a0c1463 D1 rows once the #cftk token lands. Relates to #5q7z/#214f.
- [/] [#5q7z] [recommended] 'Accept and send to TMO' duplicate-loan bug: for a loan already associated with a TMO record (deal 7a0c1463 / loan 45ddae53 has tmo_loan_number=GQI751, tmo_loan_rec_id=3840D27B..., tmo_loan_application_rec_id=cda67748), the approve flow (admin/applications/index.ts application_tmo_writeback_attempt_ -> tmo_writeback.ts:308 LOS.svc/NewLoan) sends NewLoan with the existing GQI751 -> TMO 400 'Duplicate loan number. Unable to save record.' Fix (2 parts): (1) approve/writeback must detect an existing TMO association (tmo_loan_rec_id / writeback_status='sent') and associate+mark accepted locally instead of calling NewLoan (or call an UpdateLoan endpoint); (2) hide/disable the 'Accept and send to TMO' button in lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/admin/full_applications.tsx:424 when the app/loan is already in TMO. Design Q: on accept of an already-in-TMO loan, associate-only (no TMO call) or also push UpdateLoan? Relates to #dzmm/#37ah/#214f.
- [/] [#214f] [recommended] Gate investor deal publish on acceptance: admin_deal_publish_ (app/equityfundingsource/lib/admin/repo.ts:2054) + POST /api/admin/loans/:id/deal publish a loan to the investor marketplace with NO acceptance check (only 'if (!loan) throw'); any non-Funded loan becomes status='published'. So a deal can be an Available Deal while its application is not accepted (observed: investment_deal 7a0c1463 published from loan 45ddae53 status='submitted', tmo 'Application Received', with NO full_application row). Decide the business rule ('accepted before available') and add the gate before status='published' (and/or surface why a loan is ineligible to publish). Relates to the full_applications<->loans<->investment_deals decoupling.
- [/] [#5eq8] Closing docs step (redesign): rebuild the closing-documents/notarization flow as its own step (replaces the removed Final Loan Documents section). Closing docs are wet-ink signed AND notarized on PAPER (not e-signed); EFS records a signed-status flag (+ final_docs_* D1 columns preserved) and that signed status is a BI-DIRECTIONAL sync with TMO (EFS <-> TMO), not an in-app e-signature flow. Re-introduces a notarize control and SHOULD re-gate allocation wire status (Sent/Confirmed) on notarization — the UI gate + server 409 were removed in the 2026-06-18 AvailableDeal restructure so funding is not hard-blocked in the interim.
- [/] [#efs-cutover-sso-plan] Workers.dev to custom-domain/SSO closeout: write and execute a cutover checklist for equityfundingsource.com/www routing, /login/access-callback, rollback, and Google Workspace SSO after #m6ch credentials arrive. Advances #next-steps.
- [/] [#zwws-vestings-local] [recommended] Investor dashboard phase 4 local half: capture/display vestings and special instructions in EFS D1/UI with tmo_cache_outbox enqueue; leave TMO push gated on #dzmm/#7a4d. Advances #zwws.
- [/] [#67v2-auto-advance] Admin pipeline auto-advance: define stage requirement checks from the TMO-aligned Kanban, run them against D1/tmo_cache, and enqueue audited status updates; keep replay gated by #dzmm. Advances #67v2.
- [/] [#jnzs-approval-followup] [recommended] Send/track funded-deals approval packet: attach current screenshots/copy/lien-position language plus the full_application ESIGN/UETA disclosure excerpt, record Judith/EFS reviewer decision, and convert requested edits into implementation backlog. Advances #jnzs.
- [/] [#xcvg-prod-email] [recommended] Borrower secure-message email production pass: after #f4rq/#m6ch/#p40t or #z3kx path-of-record is decided, enable borrower/admin outbound notifications, verify inbound reply threading, and add production env/runbook checks. Advances #xcvg.
- [/] [#dzmm-writeback-replay] EFS->TMO writeback replay: once #7a4d field map and #k2xg support answers arrive, replay tmo_cache_outbox with idempotency keys, conflict logging, retry/dead-letter state, and tests across broker/admin/investor writebacks. Now also covers the #tmo-split-launch 'create_loan_application' rows — applications approved while EFS ran split carry the full LOS.svc/NewLoan body plus the EFS-assigned loan number and sit at writeback_status='gated' until replayed. Advances #dzmm/#37ah/#67v2/#zwws.
- [/] [#xcvg] [recommended] Borrower message email round-trip: email notification when a borrower sends a secure-portal message, inbound email reply that appends back into the D1 chat, and a borrower-facing email when an admin replies. Builds on the shipped chat_sessions/chat_messages + admin owner. Gated on a verified Resend EFS sending domain (f4rq) and Google Workspace SMTP (m6ch/p40t). (Distinct from the operator/comms emails to Judith + Robert.)
- [/] [#jnzs] [recommended] Await Judith or EFS reviewer approval on funded-deal images, copy, and lien-position wording before invoicing or launch sign-off. The funded-deals page carries no standalone legal/disclosure text; the disclosure needing legal review is the ESIGN/UETA Electronic record and signature disclosure on the borrower full-application/document-uploads flow (full_application.tsx). Funded-deals copy was reframed as real closed deals and shipped.
- [/] [#67v2] Admin loan pipeline: TMO-aligned stages + Kanban (drag cards, auto-advance when stage requirements met) synced to dashboard; mirror TMO stages as single source of truth. From 2026-06-03 call. Relates to #dzmm/#k2xg.
- [/] [#zwws] [recommended] Investor dashboard rework — remaining phases are externally gated: 4 vestings/special-instructions (TMO writeback-gated #dzmm/#k2xg/#7a4d); 6 new-deal email + workflow-priority dashboard (#f4rq). Shipped: P1 nav (30037e3), P2 dashboard-composite landing (3e06907), P2b interest-button + distributions/statements cleanup (efs cd4253a), P3 simplified portfolio (8d40c66), P5 accreditation→annual Requirements (efs 1957f64). Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/rpzm-investor-dashboard-rework.md. Queue one phase at a time.
- [/] [#next-steps] Remaining EFS workers.dev production state: D1 API token unblocked (Cloudflare API token at `passage btak/d1/CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`); migrations 0025/0026 are already applied; Cloudflare Access env vars are deployed for /login/access-callback on workers.dev using the one-time PIN IdP. Custom domain cutover remains intentionally deferred; true Google Workspace SSO remains gated on Google admin credentials.
- [/] [#dzmm] TMO webhooks UNAVAILABLE per operator (2026-06-13). Read-side tightened polling is shipped (scheduled tmo-sync with configurable interval + due-gating + tmo_cache read mirror). Remaining gated: EFS to TMO writeback (tmo_cache_outbox replay) needs the #7a4d write field map + #k2xg support answers before it can replay.
- [/] [#dropbox-sync-adapter] Dropbox sync adapter: #dropbox-sync-contract shipped the shared documents Dropbox metadata, document_sync_logs idempotency schema, pure sync planner, and mocked adapter tests. Remaining: after Dropbox access is available, wire the real credential-backed worker to push/pull R2_DOCUMENTS with retries, backfill, tombstone replay, and per-document sync logs.
- [/] [#tmo-clone-apply] [operator-verify] Execute the anonymized live-to-sandbox TMO clone and the staging D1 refresh per prds/tmo-sandbox-clone-and-staging-refresh-plan.md section 8. CLONE SOURCE CONFIRMED 2026-08-02: use tmo-backups/2026-08-01/2026-08-01T17-15-48-000Z.json or later - it is the first schedule-bearing production artifact (14 of 31 loans, 43 schedule rows; the 2026-07-30 and 2026-07-31 artifacts are flat zero). Still blocked on two operator actions: (1) create passage btak/equityfundingsource/anonymize_seed, which must be stable forever because regenerating it re-pseudonymizes everything and breaks the sandbox-to-staging joins; (2) an explicit go for the destructive steps, which delete sandbox loans and wipe-and-load staging D1. Everything else is built and green as of EFS 20d7a416: rehearse with tmo-sandbox-clone.ts --simulate, then --from-r2 dry run, then --from-r2 --apply, then d1-staging-refresh.ts dry run and --apply. Coordinate with #tmo-sandbox-purge-apply, which gates the same purge.
- [/] [#efs-email-subdomain] [operator-verify] Grant `passage:btak/equityfundingsource/production/cloudflare_api_token` Email Sending, Email Routing, and required DNS write access on `equityfundingsource.com`; then enable the `efs.equityfundingsource.com` sending/routing subdomain, route `reply@efs.equityfundingsource.com` plus-addressed replies to the EFS Worker, push and deploy EFS commit `c6d4133e`, and verify login, invite, notification, and inbound-reply delivery end to end. Current evidence: Email Sending list succeeds for the apex, but Wrangler enable and direct POST `/zones/426085c68d8d584075c824ff1d715926/email/sending/subdomains` fail with Cloudflare code 10000; the separate infra token has no production-account access.

## Notes

<!-- agent:notes -->
How can I instruct Judith to create a Cloudflare account for EFS? She does not have much time today so please make brief instructions for her to follow.
---
- Admin loan delete: /api/admin/loans/:id
- Admin bulk loan delete: /api/admin/loans/bulk-delete
- Admin TMO loan delete: /api/admin/tmo-loans/:loan_number
- Admin TMO bulk delete: /api/admin/tmo-loans/bulk-delete
- Borrower self-delete: /api/borrower/loans/:id
- Admin user delete: /api/admin/users/:id, because loans.user_id cascades from users, then investment_deals.loan_id
  cascades from loans
---
Is there an admin for the borrower portal messages? Can we have an email notification whenever a borrow sends a message? Can we support an email response back into the chat? Can the borrower receive emails whenever an admin responds with a message?
---
After 20:30
- login to TMO. Make sure we are using the correct credentials.
- TMO Syncs

We have not cut over the DNS today. The current CF environment will be staging. Please setup another CF environment for production. At some point, we will have EFS have custody of the CF account, possibly today. But I want to have a production environment ready to go in case it is needed.

## Completed / Reaped

<!-- agent:icebox -->
- [ ] [#efs-prod-secrets] [operator-verify] Cutover prerequisite, NOT a live outage — the [env.production] Cloudflare environment is provisioned and deployed but not launched (no DNS, empty D1, no traffic). It has 4 secrets; the live default env has 13. Present in [env.production]: ADMIN_GLOBAL_PASSWORD, AUTH_SECRET, CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID, CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN. Missing: TMO_API_TOKEN, TMO_DATABASE, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3, DROPBOX_APP_KEY, DROPBOX_APP_SECRET, DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN, and one more. If DNS were cut over today, every TMO, S3, and Dropbox call would fail closed. Push with 'bun run cf:secrets:push:production'. Secrets are per-account AND per-environment, so do this AFTER #efs-cf-account-custody or it has to be redone. Discovered 2026-07-18.
- [ ] [#efs-cf-account-custody] [operator-verify] Move EFS to its own Cloudflare account. Both environments currently live in Brian's personal account (1e7e194ff8da4ad9e40ce041aea84f76), which also hosts unrelated projects. STEP 1 (Judith, instructions drafted 2026-07-18): sign up at dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up with a SHARED EFS address (becomes billing + recovery contact), verify the email (hard prerequisite — invites and 2FA both fail without it), invite Brian as Super Administrator via Manage Account -> Members -> Invite, enable 2FA, have a company card ready for the R2 checkout. Super Administrator is required, not just Workers Platform Admin, because R2 activation is a purchase and the deploy pipeline needs an account-owned API token. STEP 2 (Brian): D1 databases and R2 buckets cannot move between accounts — create them in the new account, update the ids under [env.production] in wrangler.toml, export+import D1, copy R2, re-push secrets (per-account AND per-environment), then repoint DNS. Sequencing: do this before #efs-prod-seed to migrate the data once instead of twice. Advances #efs-dns-cutover. KEPT OPEN 2026-07-18: not started — this cycle was preempted by the operator's live Jeff Blake / Lucas Huang TMO investigation prompt.
- [ ] [#efs-dns-cutover] [operator-verify] equityfundingsource.com does not resolve: no A/AAAA record, nameservers still ns1/2/3.dreamhost.com, and wrangler.toml declares no route or custom_domain. The worker is live and correct at equityfundingsource.brian-takita.workers.dev. Needs registrar + Cloudflare access: move the zone to Cloudflare (or add a CNAME at the registrar), add the custom domain / route to wrangler.toml, verify /login/access-callback still works, and allow for NS propagation. This is the remaining gate on the weekend launch. Advances #tcb0 / #efs-cutover-sso-plan. KEPT OPEN 2026-07-18: not started — this cycle was preempted by the operator's live Jeff Blake / Lucas Huang TMO investigation prompt.
- [ ] [#vcyr] Send rwaldman100+admin@gmail.com admin login link to btak.dev+admin@gmail.com once a working Cloudflare Email Sending API token is available or Brian explicitly confirms an alternate sender/body. Verified Robert is active admin; current local Cloudflare/Resend credentials cannot send. (Deferred from backlog 2026-07-03; operator replaced the line — restore if unintended.)
- [ ] [#cutover-checklist] [recommended] Write (do not execute) the workers.dev to equityfundingsource.com custom-domain + Google Workspace SSO cutover checklist doc: routing for /, /funded-deals, admin routes; /login/access-callback; rollback steps. Execution stays gated on #m6ch creds. Advances #efs-cutover-sso-plan/#next-steps.
- [ ] [#ghl-stage-bridge] [recommended] Implement an event-driven GHL stage bridge from EFS Deal Pipeline state to HighLevel contacts/opportunities/workflows for Processing, Underwriting, Terms negotiation, and Closing while keeping EFS/D1 canonical for loan, lender-selection, borrower portal, document, audit, and funding state.
- [ ] [#xt4d] Inventory TMO usage once access is restored: screenshots, exports, required fields, statuses, document flows, notifications, reports, integrations, and workflows EFS actually uses.
- [ ] [#0e1p] Draft phased TMO replacement roadmap after the demo: EFS-first MVP, TMO sync/cutover plan, document
- [ ] [#f4rq] Verify an EFS-owned sending domain in Resend, then switch APPLICATION_LEAD_NOTIFICATION_FROM and APPLICATION_LEAD_NOTIFICATION_TO from testing-mode values to EFS production addresses.
- [ ] [#k2xg] Send Robert the six-question TMO outbound webhook prompt in src/equityfundingsource-dev/docs/tmo-webhooks-question.md for him to forward to Mortgage Office, then record the response and decide push vs. tightened polling.
- [ ] [#m6ch] Get Google Suite admin credentials from Robert (SMTP + Google Calendar integration)
- [ ] [#p40t] [recommended] Google Calendar/G Suite notification integration after Google admin credentials are available
- [ ] [#q2x2] HTML email templates: lighter navy + gold, 2-3 drip for PBM orphan investor outreach
- [ ] [#x5rn] Convert EFS logo JPEG -> transparent PNG/SVG (Robert sent JPEG)
- [ ] [#kzt6] Collect testimonials for carousel (6-12 min: investors, brokers, borrowers) — push Judith + Robert helping
- [ ] [#kxsx] Form submission pipeline
- [ ] [#4vb5] Online presence cleanup (after Judith approves)
- [ ] [#a3gc] Consolidate domains under equityfundingsource.com
- [ ] [#zhyg] Take down/redirect Weebly and WordPress sites
- [ ] [#vd6p] Update directory listings (Yelp, Manta, hard money directories)
- [ ] [#tfee] Consolidate Facebook pages
- [ ] [#1w4n] Optimize LinkedIn profile
- [ ] [#7fx4] OCR ingestion schema/state machine: add provider-neutral document_processing tables for documents, versions, OCR runs, pages/chunks, extracted fields, entity mentions/edges, review decisions, provider cost, and retry/error state.
- [ ] [#d1h2] OCR provider adapter: process private R2 documents through pluggable parsers starting with Ragie Parse or Workers AI/Claude where appropriate; keep original R2 object as source of truth and persist source page/bounding-box evidence.
- [ ] [#f5kq] OCR admin review workflow: show extracted fields with source evidence, confidence, and diffable approval/rejection before any TMO borrower, loan, lender, or loan-application writeback.
- [ ] [#ntcr] Search/index spike: keep D1/R2 canonical and evaluate Ragie index plus Cloudflare Vectorize/SQL edge tables before adopting Neo4j, FalkorDB, Convex, or another separate graph database.
- [ ] [#7a4d] [recommended] OCR/TMO field extraction: custom/fillable docs -> reviewed extracted fields -> TMO update/create flow
- [ ] [#k9zj] Graph/vector database for Judith's document search dashboard (cross-doc search, any doc type)
- [ ] [#x0px] Tier 1: Workers AI pre-screening
- [ ] [#xgqg] Tier 2: Claude API document review
- [ ] [#kf1p] Tier 3: Ragie Parse + Index for approved docs
- [ ] [#4ktv] Discuss Ragie content validation with Bob Remeika (scheduled call)
- [ ] [#dvmr] [recommended] Corky: add long mono-call mixed-speaker recovery (separate diarization confidence, tighter bad-span detection, forced re-diarize on flagged windows)
- [ ] [#e1kb] Point equityfundingsource.com and www.equityfundingsource.com at the Cloudflare Pages project equityfundingsource, then verify / and /funded-deals on the custom domain; if admin routes are expected on the custom domain too, decide whether to route those paths to the Worker or move the dynamic app fully behind the same hostname.
- [ ] [#z3kx] GoHighLevel CRM as messaging/notifications path of record (Robert's enterprise GHL); integrate with the site so notifications also surface in-app; avoid SendGrid/extra recurring fees. From 2026-06-03 call. Relates to #xcvg.
