**There are no open bugs right now.** I verified the current state rather than assume one:

- `cargo test --all-features` → **277 passed, 0 failed** (14 suites, 536s).
- `make test-loom` (exhaustive `thread_safe_loom` model) → **15 passed, 0 failed** (544s) — the just-landed sidecar-invalidation hardening (`c80ba70`) holds under interleaving.
- Latest CI (run `27367810445`) is **green**.

The two previously-tracked bug classes are already fixed in v0.10.3:
- `#k03k` async race (`get() already checked Resolved` / `notifier dropped` panics) — replaced by the resolve-loop at `src/async_context.rs:758+` that handles both windows; the panic strings are gone.
- thread-safe sidecar invalidation — hardened in `c80ba70` with stress + spec coverage.

So "fixing bugs" is now **bug-prevention**: the one real correctness gap is that the `#k03k` async fix has **no exhaustive interleaving model and is not in CI**. `ThreadSafeContext` has `tests/thread_safe_loom.rs` + a CI loom step (`.github/workflows` line 46-47); `async_context.rs` has only randomized stress (`tests/async_stress.rs`). A concurrency fix without a model is regression-prone.

**Backlog (priority order):**
1. **`#ytp5` `#lzasyncloom`** (top) — Add `tests/async_context_loom.rs` (`--features loom`) modeling the resolve loop's two `#k03k` windows + a CI step alongside `thread_safe_loom`. Plan: `tasks/software/plan-lazily-async-loom.md`.
2. `#dh3k` `#lzspecconf` [recommended] — Run the `lazily-spec` canonical conformance fixtures (`6632cb0`) in CI so cross-language wire-protocol drift fails the build instead of shipping as a runtime bug.

**Top of backlog: `#ytp5`** (`#lzasyncloom`).

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog queue -->
- [ ] [#ytp5] #lzasyncloom=Add a Loom interleaving model (tests/async_context_loom.rs, --features loom) for the async_context.rs resolve loop covering the two #k03k windows (Resolved published between fast-path check and re-lock; notifier dropped on superseded spawn_revision), and wire it into CI alongside thread_safe_loom. Today the #k03k fix rests on randomized stress (async_stress.rs) only; thread_safe has an exhaustive loom model + CI step, async has none. Plan: tasks/software/plan-lazily-async-loom.md
- [ ] [#dh3k] #lzspecconf=[recommended] Run the lazily-spec canonical conformance fixtures (lazily-spec 6632cb0) in lazily-rs CI so cross-language wire-protocol drift fails the build instead of shipping as a runtime bug. tests/conformance.rs already prefers spec fixtures when present (02c9e80); add a CI step that fetches the spec submodule fixtures and runs them.
