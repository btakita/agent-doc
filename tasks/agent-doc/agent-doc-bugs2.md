### Re: Response

The timeout was caused by an unresolved editor/CRDT write, not document size or a dead controller.

Two events were conflated:

- The explicit 90-second timeout was the `UserPromptSubmit` preflight budget, defined in [preflight_hook.rs](/home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/src/agent-doc/src/preflight_hook.rs:59)—not the Stop hook itself.
- The Stop hook encountered the same unresolved state because it starts with `session-check` and captured-finalize recovery in [lib.rs](/home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/src/agent-doc/agent-doc-codex-stop-io/src/lib.rs:147).

For `agent-doc-bugs2.md`, the log records:

- A stale JetBrains plugin generation and repeated detached-authority refusals.
- A retained compact write that never converged.
- `PayloadAbsentFromConvergedContent`, which blocked session closeout ([ops.log](/home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/.agent-doc/logs/ops.log:86619)).
- Two clears and a duplicate dispatch while the actor was busy.

Thus preflight—and later Stop/session-check—waited on editor convergence until the hook runner killed it. The controller and supervisor are currently fresh and `ready`, ruling out a persistent crash.

The `monsterrodholders.md` dialog exposes a related bug: the “now in HEAD” note is printed unconditionally after the controller accepts the compact request ([rpc.rs](/home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/src/agent-doc/agent-doc-controller-io/src/project_controller/rpc.rs:6652)), even when delivery is merely retained with `delivery_converged=false`. JetBrains also merges stderr into command output ([TerminalUtil.kt](/home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/src/agent-doc/editors/jetbrains/src/main/kotlin/com/github/btakita/agentdoc/TerminalUtil.kt:1374)).

Four Compact Exchange attempts were recorded, but no compact commit landed after the 18:41:06 commit. The working document is only 8 additions/2 deletions from HEAD, so there is no wholesale content loss—but the note was premature and retries accumulated retained writes. Avoid further Compact Exchange retries until the JetBrains plugin generation is refreshed and the retained state settles.

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog priority queue -->
- [ ] [#harnessresumemap] Implement a harness-keyed resume map with claude, codex, and opencode entries; each launch or restart must read only the active harness key, and legacy scalar resume values must migrate only into the document active harness. Add cross-harness restart and compatibility regressions.
- [/] [#clearsubmitunobservedverify] [operator-verify] Live re-proof for #clearsubmitunobserved (0.35.225): reproduce the reported haiven-dev.md sequence — let the supervisor go dead (or `session restart-supervisor`), then Run Agent Doc so the flow cold-starts a replacement and immediately runs Clear Session Context on the fresh pane. Expect it to SUCCEED instead of failing with `result=submission_unobserved ... unblocker=clear_submission_unobserved`, and expect `session_clear_submit_cleared_state_probe ... result=cleared_state_proven retained_lines=<small>` in ops.log. Then the half that must not regress: on a pane holding a real conversation, break submission (e.g. leave the composer wedged) and confirm the clear still fails closed with `result=conversation_retained`. Unit tests pin the predicate against synthetic captures; only a live pane exercises the tmux scrollback capture and the real harness prompt shapes.

## Review
 
<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#pypi10gbquota] [operator-verify] Request a PyPI agent-doc project-size limit increase or remove superseded releases. The 0.35.248 workflow built and attested all four wheels, then PyPI rejected upload because the project has reached its external 10 GB storage quota.
- [/] [#operatorverifylive] [operator-verify] #panewindowdriftverify Live-pane proof for #panewindowdrift (0.35.187): with a two-column agent-doc layout, move the focused document's pane into the stash window, then trigger an editor tab/focus change for that document. Expect NO select-pane onto the stashed pane (ops.log shows pane_layout_projection ... focus=focus_pane_not_co_visible:...), the structural reconcile surfaces the pane, and the retry focuses it in the agent-doc window. Unblocks on a human watching a real IDE + tmux session.
- [/] [#operatorverifyrestart] [operator-verify] Restart a running JetBrains IDE (installed plugin is 0.2.350; this item originally named 0.2.340, long superseded — the single restart in #stickymdpaneverify covers it), then move from fpe-service-topology.md in a one-pane surface to agent-doc-bugs2.md in its two-column surface and confirm the first selection restores two tmux panes without a second navigation.
- [/] [#stickymdpaneverify] [operator-verify] #stickymdpane live proof: restart a JetBrains IDE — plugin 0.2.350 is ALREADY INSTALLED in all four IDE configs, so only the restart is missing, and that one restart also satisfies the install precondition for #operatorverifyrestart, #rebootselfhealverify and #falsetyping-guard — then open a two-column split with an agent-doc document in each and switch ONE column to a source file. Expect tmux to keep both panes with that column still showing its last document, instead of collapsing to one pane. Then close that split entirely and confirm tmux DOES collapse — the fallback must be memory, not invention. Unit tests pin the pure resolution but cannot prove the live IDE wiring.
- [/] [#stalesupervisorreexecdrain] [operator-verify] One supervisor is still stranded on the pre-fix image and cannot self-rescue: PID 4069526 (`agent-doc start --resume 019fd336-7ce8-7ed1-8141-d77021a00085 src/boost-client/tasks/monsterrodholders.md`, started 2026-08-05 19:12:50 EDT) maps a DELETED binary and, by the very defect #stalereexecstarve fixes, can never reach the recycle decision to adopt 0.35.186. The fix is preventive, not retroactive -- it lives in code that process does not run. Recovery requires interrupting a live Claude child (PID 2653032), which is an operator call, not an agent-doable step: either let it retire naturally when that session ends, or `kill 4069526` and re-route the document. Verify afterwards with `readlink /proc/<newpid>/exe` showing no `(deleted)` suffix. Every other live supervisor (336290, 523099, 577794, 837794, 3268523, 3854486, 3956615) already maps the current inode.
- [/] [#rebootselfhealverify] [operator-verify] Live proof for #rebootselfheal after restarting the IDE (installed plugin is 0.2.350; this item originally named 0.2.339 — reload-lib swaps the cdylib but NOT the Kotlin package, so a restart is still required, and the restart in #stickymdpaneverify covers it). Reboot the host (or stop the controller and leave a stale .agent-doc/controller.sock behind), then run Sync Tmux Layout and Run Agent Doc from the IDE and confirm both succeed without the `pane-layout state projection publish failed ... Connection refused` notification and without a human deleting the socket. Then confirm the passive lane is still free: click between editor tabs with NO controller running and verify no controller is launched (editors/SPEC.md requires the surface-observation lane to never launch one) - grep ops.log for a controller bootstrap around the tab clicks. Both reboot states are already proven end-to-end against the installed cdylib; only the in-IDE path needs a human eyeball.
- [/] [#hvw0] [operator-verify] Rotate the CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN secret on github.com/btakita/skill-harness — the current one returns 403 authentication failed, so CI cannot publish to crates.io (v0.1.3 was published manually from the passage token btak/CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN). Needs a repo-secret write, which is operator-gated. CORRECTION 2026-08-08: the claim that every tagged release now FAILS loudly at the publish step (intended behavior after 32836ad) is UNTESTED — no tag has run since. The newest Release run is v0.1.3 from 2026-07-18 and its `Publish to crates.io` step reports success, which is exactly the false green. #hvw0publishproof carries the static check.
- [/] [#c8tb] [operator-verify] Live #jbroutebusystall proof (0b49105e1): with the supervisor socket down (route logs `route_dispatch_only_authoritative_degraded_direct_pane supervisor_health=no_socket`) and the pane mid-turn, click JB Run Agent Doc. Expect `route_start` -> `route_success` in the attempt ledger to drop from ~17s to under ~2s, with `route_existing_pane_busy_active_turn_skip_wait` in ops.log and the SAME outcome as before (`route_existing_pane_already_running`, pane focused, no duplicate injection). Unit tests pin the cue gating but cannot prove the live latency win.
- [/] [#mtds] [operator-verify] #panedraftunblocker live proof: on a Claude pane whose footer reads `⏵⏵ bypass permissions on · 1 shell · ← for agents` (the variant without `(shift+tab to cycle)`), with an EMPTY composer and no active turn, trigger JB Run Agent Doc. Expect dispatch to succeed instead of refusing with `timed_out` / `unblocker=wait_for_dispatch_ready_prompt`. Then repeat with unsent text typed in the composer and expect the new refusal naming the draft with `unblocker=submit_or_clear_pane_draft`, and NO injection over that text. Finally confirm a genuinely mid-turn pane (live spinner, bare prompt) still refuses as busy. Fixed in 17848a927. This item named binary 0.35.6 and a pending idle-boundary recycle; the installed binary is now 0.35.174 and has recycled many times, so only the live eyeball remains.
- [/] [#falsetyping-guard] #agent-doc-bug provenance-aware visible-write guard. INTEGRATED to main (merge on 5bcfc07b) + binary/cdylib installed + recycled; guard tests 7/7 green. JB install step DONE — the installed plugin is 0.2.350 in all four IDE configs, superseding the 0.2.205 zip this item named; only an IDE restart is missing, covered by #stickymdpaneverify. VS Code 0.2.38 install is UNVERIFIED — no agent-doc extension found under ~/.vscode/extensions. REMAINING (operator): restart the IDE, then live proof — type during replica churn (no wedge) + genuine unsaved edit still fails closed.

- [ ] [#agentsignals] #agent-doc-feature [future/separate] Add a realtime agent:signals element after core realtime convergence is stable. Start with deterministic built-in signals for tests, queue, supervisor, and ipc; design custom user-defined signals as plugin-backed tracked work with Rust as the first target and future multi-language support; use tasks/software/realtime-signals-patchboard.md as the GUI/semi-programmatic reference; keep MLP enhancement optional/experimental and not load-bearing for deterministic states.
- [ ] [#qloop1] #agent-doc-feature Define durable queue loop annotation syntax and parser/rendering behavior: mark loop-only queue/backlog entries, keep annotation/state out of prompt completion proof, and expose a stable current-item marker for editor/supervisor surfaces.
- [ ] [#qloop2] #agent-doc-feature Implement idle-loop scheduling for annotated loop items: when normal drainable queue work is empty, dispatch loop items in deterministic sequence, persist the loop cursor/last-run state, and prove regular queue items always preempt loop work.
- [ ] [#qloop3] #agent-doc-feature Add loop poll controls: global default poll period plus per-loop override, next-run time gates, bounded backoff/jitter, and tests proving no tight spin when there are no relevant events.
- [ ] [#qloop4] #agent-doc-feature Add event-aware loop scheduling: record deterministic event counters/timestamps and let loop items schedule earlier/later based on event frequency before any model-assisted scheduling hook.
- [ ] [#qobs1] #agent-doc-feature Add a bounded observer telemetry snapshot surface: supervisor/session actors expose compact per-document state (cycle phase, queue head, actor readiness, IPC inflight, recent typed ops-log markers, and artifact handles) without dumping raw transcripts by default.
- [ ] [#qobs2] #agent-doc-feature Implement deterministic observer rules that scan session-check/preflight/ops-log snapshots for annotated issues and recurring failure patterns, then file deduped session-doc backlog bugs with evidence paths and stable issue fingerprints.
- [ ] [#qobs3] #agent-doc-feature Add a sidecar observer agent-doc loop that can monitor all running project sessions from snapshot artifacts, rate-limit bug filing, avoid pane interference, and route created bug items to the correct session document or a configured observer inbox.
- [ ] [#qobs4] #agent-doc-feature Add model-assisted observer triage as advisory-only: feed compact snapshot/context-pack handles to a subscription or local model, require deterministic evidence before auto-filing bugs, and record model provenance/confidence on suggestions.
- [ ] [#qlm1] #agent-doc-feature Define queue item backend-selection syntax for local-model execution, separate from queued `/model <tier>` switches: support explicit per-item backend/model annotations on normal and loop queue items without changing prompt text or completion proof.
- [ ] [#qlm2] #agent-doc-feature Implement a local-model queue dispatcher backend that can run eligible queue/loop items through a configured local model, capture stdout/structured results, and write responses through the normal agent-doc closeout boundary.
- [ ] [#qlm3] #agent-doc-feature Add local-model dispatch safety gates and telemetry: capability checks, GPU/resource lease integration, fallback policy, provenance logs, and tests proving local-model queue items cannot be silently marked complete without a committed response/proof.
- [ ] [#exttasksources] #agent-doc-feature Add external task source adapters that project PM-tool tasks into the active document/work graph as source-backed nodes, keeping local queue/closeout authority document-owned and making remote push-back explicit and audited.
