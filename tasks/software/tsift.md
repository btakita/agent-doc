## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#kgconfreqverify] [operator-verify] Verify the confidence-required schema change (#kgconf, payload_schema in packages/tsift-kg/src/ollama.rs) does not reduce extraction yield on the live local model (Qwen3-32B-Q4) via an A/B over a real corpus; if required-confidence cuts entities/relations or induces hallucinated scores, relax to prompt-only + the derived-default fallback. Needs GPU + Ollama (operator-gated).
- [/] [#vmax] [operator-verify] Enable crates.io OIDC publishing for tsift (advances review #1td4; code already shipped in fe4144b/f29f7a2, release.yml crates job uses rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action@v1). Operator-gated steps (need crates.io account + browser 2FA — agent cannot perform): (1) On crates.io register a Trusted Publisher for EACH of the 23 tsift crates — GitHub repo btakita/tsift, workflow release.yml, no environment: tsift-core, tsift -md-ast, tsift-graph, tsift-sqlite, tsift-algorithms, tsift-resolution, tsift-cache, tsift-tokensave, tsift-libsql, tsift-index, tsift-summarize, tsift-quality, tsift-agent-doc, tsift-digest, tsift-search, tsift-status, tsift-session, tsift-memory, tsift-memgraphrag, tsift-surrealdb, tsift-cli, tsift, tsift-sim-world. (2) Enable the gate var: gh variable set TSIFT_ENABLE_CRATES_PUBLISH --body true. (3) Force-move the v0.1.70 tag to HEAD and push to re-trigger; confirm the publish-crates.io job authenticates via OIDC (no CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN) and publishes.
- [/] [#1td4] Release infra: crates.io publish job in .github/workflows/release.yml is MIGRATED to OIDC trusted publishing (commit fe4144b, on origin/main f29f7a2; uses rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action@v1, id-token: write, no CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN). Code complete. Remaining is operator-gated and tracked as actionable backlog #vmax: register the Trusted Publisher per crate on crates.io (23 crates), set repo var TSIFT_ENABLE_CRATES_PUBLISH=true, then re-tag v0.1.70 to verify OIDC publish. Stays gated until operator completes crates.io registration.
