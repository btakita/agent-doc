## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog priority queue -->
- [ ] [#opencodeharnessswitch] #agent-doc-bug Switching a document from codex to opencode and restarting: session did not become dispatch-ready in 30s (no_prompt) for opencode. The dispatch-ready chain (startup_ready::auto_start_dispatch_ready_block -> pane_ready_prompt_candidate -> project_pane_composer_at_cursor) has OpenCode-specific handling but the bare prompt check (is_dispatch_ready_prompt_line: matches '>' | '>') may miss OpenCode's full-screen Bubbletea TUI idle state. Needs fresh reproduction with pane capture evidence to pinpoint whether the TUI initialization exceeds 30s or the composer projection returns Absent/Busy instead of ReadyEmpty. Reported on monsterrodholders.md (boost-client).

## Review
 
<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#operatorverifyresolve] [operator-verify] Resolve the current JetBrains File Cache Conflict with Cancel / Keep memory changes, then save or make one editor mutation so the plugin publishes the current editor cut; confirm the retained closeout commits and a later Compact Exchange no longer fails on the historical stranded duplicate heading.
- [/] [#operatorverifyrestart] [operator-verify] Restart a running JetBrains IDE to activate plugin 0.2.340, then move from fpe-service-topology.md in a one-pane surface to agent-doc-bugs2.md in its two-column surface and confirm the first selection restores two tmux panes without a second navigation.
- [/] [#rebootselfhealverify] [operator-verify] Live proof for #rebootselfheal after restarting the IDE onto JetBrains plugin 0.2.339 (reload-lib swaps the cdylib but NOT the Kotlin package, so a restart is required). Reboot the host (or stop the controller and leave a stale .agent-doc/controller.sock behind), then run Sync Tmux Layout and Run Agent Doc from the IDE and confirm both succeed without the 'pane-layout state projection publish failed ... Connection refused' notification and without a human deleting the socket. Then confirm the passive lane is still free: click between editor tabs with NO controller running and verify no controller is launched (editors/SPEC.md requires the surface-observation lane to never launch one) - grep ops.log for a controller bootstrap around the tab clicks. Both reboot states are already proven end-to-end against the installed cdylib; only the in-IDE path needs a human eyeball.
- [/] [#hvw0] [operator-verify] Rotate the CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN secret on github.com/btakita/skill-harness — the current one returns 403 authentication failed, so CI cannot publish to crates.io (v0.1.3 was published manually from the passage token btak/CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN). Needs a repo-secret write, which is operator-gated. Until it is rotated, every tagged release will now FAIL loudly at the publish step (that is the intended new behavior after 32836ad; it previously reported success)
- [/] [#c8tb] [operator-verify] Live #jbroutebusystall proof (0b49105e1): with the supervisor socket down (route logs `route_dispatch_only_authoritative_degraded_direct_pane supervisor_health=no_socket`) and the pane mid-turn, click JB Run Agent Doc. Expect `route_start` -> `route_success` in the attempt ledger to drop from ~17s to under ~2s, with `route_existing_pane_busy_active_turn_skip_wait` in ops.log and the SAME outcome as before (`route_existing_pane_already_running`, pane focused, no duplicate injection). Unit tests pin the cue gating but cannot prove the live latency win.
- [/] [#operatorverifylive] [operator-verify] #relaylockpoison live proof: with the JB plugin loaded, force a replica panic (the crash-2026-07-09 shape: agent_doc_replica_apply_local) and confirm later replica calls still succeed instead of returning -1/null for the life of the IDE. This is the behavior the whole migration exists to guarantee and it cannot be proven without a host IDE.
- [/] [#mtds] [operator-verify] #panedraftunblocker live proof: on a Claude pane whose footer reads `⏵⏵ bypass permissions on · 1 shell · ← for agents` (the variant without `(shift+tab to cycle)`), with an EMPTY composer and no active turn, trigger JB Run Agent Doc. Expect dispatch to succeed instead of refusing with `timed_out` / `unblocker=wait_for_dispatch_ready_prompt`. Then repeat with unsent text typed in the composer and expect the new refusal naming the draft with `unblocker=submit_or_clear_pane_draft`, and NO injection over that text. Finally confirm a genuinely mid-turn pane (live spinner, bare `❯`) still refuses as busy. Fixed in 17848a927, installed 0.35.6; needs the supervisor idle-boundary recycle to pick up the fresh binary.
- [/] [#falsetyping-guard] #agent-doc-bug provenance-aware visible-write guard. INTEGRATED to main (merge on 5bcfc07b) + binary/cdylib installed + recycled; guard tests 7/7 green; JB 0.2.205 zip + VS Code 0.2.38 compiled. REMAINING (operator): install JB plugin zip (build/distributions/agent-doc-jetbrains-0.2.205.zip) + reload IDE, install VS Code 0.2.38, then live proof — type during replica churn (no wedge) + genuine unsaved edit still fails closed. NOTE: bugs2.md can still wedge until the IDE plugin is reloaded (loaded plugin still calls FFI v2 → conservative fail-closed).

- [ ] [#agentsignals] #agent-doc-feature [future/separate] Add a realtime agent:signals element after core realtime convergence is stable. Start with deterministic built-in signals for tests, queue, supervisor, and ipc; design custom user-defined signals as plugin-backed tracked work with Rust as the first target and future multi-language support; use tasks/software/realtime-signals-patchboard.md as the GUI/semi-programmatic reference; keep MLP enhancement optional/experimental and not load-bearing for deterministic states.
- [ ] [#qloop1] #agent-doc-feature Define durable queue loop annotation syntax and parser/rendering behavior: mark loop-only queue/backlog entries, keep annotation/state out of prompt completion proof, and expose a stable current-item marker for editor/supervisor surfaces.
- [ ] [#qloop2] #agent-doc-feature Implement idle-loop scheduling for annotated loop items: when normal drainable queue work is empty, dispatch loop items in deterministic sequence, persist the loop cursor/last-run state, and prove regular queue items always preempt loop work.
- [ ] [#qloop3] #agent-doc-feature Add loop poll controls: global default poll period plus per-loop override, next-run time gates, bounded backoff/jitter, and tests proving no tight spin when there are no relevant events.
- [ ] [#qloop4] #agent-doc-feature Add event-aware loop scheduling: record deterministic event counters/timestamps and let loop items schedule earlier/later based on event frequency before any model-assisted scheduling hook.
- [ ] [#qobs1] #agent-doc-feature Add a bounded observer telemetry snapshot surface: supervisor/session actors expose compact per-document state (cycle phase, queue head, actor readiness, IPC inflight, recent typed ops-log markers, and artifact handles) without dumping raw transcripts by default.
- [ ] [#qobs2] #agent-doc-feature Implement deterministic observer rules that scan session-check/preflight/ops-log snapshots for annotated issues and recurring failure patterns, then file deduped session-doc backlog bugs with evidence paths and stable issue fingerprints.
- [ ] [#qobs3] #agent-doc-feature Add a sidecar observer agent-doc loop that can monitor all running project sessions from snapshot artifacts, rate-limit bug filing, avoid pane interference, and route created bug items to the correct session document or a configured observer inbox.
- [ ] [#qobs4] #agent-doc-feature Add model-assisted observer triage as advisory-only: feed compact snapshot/context-pack handles to a subscription or local model, require deterministic evidence before auto-filing bugs, and record model provenance/confidence on suggestions.
- [ ] [#qlm1] #agent-doc-feature Define queue item backend-selection syntax for local-model execution, separate from queued `/model <tier>` switches: support explicit per-item backend/model annotations on normal and loop queue items without changing prompt text or completion proof.
- [ ] [#qlm2] #agent-doc-feature Implement a local-model queue dispatcher backend that can run eligible queue/loop items through a configured local model, capture stdout/structured results, and write responses through the normal agent-doc closeout boundary.
- [ ] [#qlm3] #agent-doc-feature Add local-model dispatch safety gates and telemetry: capability checks, GPU/resource lease integration, fallback policy, provenance logs, and tests proving local-model queue items cannot be silently marked complete without a committed response/proof.
- [ ] [#exttasksources] #agent-doc-feature Add external task source adapters that project PM-tool tasks into the active document/work graph as source-backed nodes, keeping local queue/closeout authority document-owned and making remote push-back explicit and audited.
