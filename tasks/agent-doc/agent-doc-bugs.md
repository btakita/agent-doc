## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#frontendlivedispatch] [operator-verify] [agent-doc] Live confirmation that Run Agent Doc on haiven-dev frontend.md dispatches (fixes 0.35.483: runfrontenddispatch 3d9fbad86, dispatchreadyselfheal 81b9e1910). Precondition met 2026-10-11: pane %166's supervisor re-registered on the current binary (pid 3851566, healthy/ready) and install_fanout recycles now settle. Remaining: the operator clicks Run Agent Doc on frontend.md; pass = route_dispatch_only_recycle_inflight_ready_after_start outcome=settled or supervisor_recycle_graph_settled reason=dispatch_ready_after_start in haiven-dev ops.log, with no refusal=recycle_ttl_elapsed_supervisor_alive.
- [/] [#jb262dynlauncherrecommen] [recommended] [operator-verify] [agent-doc] Operator decision: jb262dynupgrade (153c72916) chose the accurate-warning option (a 262 package reports declined_by=modular_package and falls back to file replacement + restart). Either keep that as the supported policy (then close this), or authorize a real restart-free launcher for the exact-262 split-mode plugin that swaps backend + frontend (the frontend may run in a separate JetBrains Client process), proven against a live 262 IDE.
- [/] [#pypiquotarecheck] Track pypi/support#12214 (agent-doc project limit request, 25 GiB) to a decision. Unblocked mechanically by a human reply on pypi/support#12214, or make pypi-quota-check reporting a ceiling in reach. Rechecked 2026-10-12: pre-cutover 131 releases 8.361 GiB (0.35.113..0.35.343), post-cutover 91 releases 3.19 MiB (mean 35.9 KiB), about 47,722 further releases fit; VERDICT headroom fine. The support issue is still open with one comment, unchanged since 2026-09-10. Nothing to act on or delete. If the grant lands, record it and drop this item; deletion stays reserved for a ceiling the authenticated check reports.
