## Pending / Not Built

<!-- agent:backlog -->
- [ ] [#autodag] [recommended] Add an agent-doc auto-DAG planner for queued do/compound directives: parse explicit depends-on text, backlog ids, graph/conflict evidence, and job packets into a topological schedule; fail closed on cycles, missing ids, stale graph evidence, or ambiguous ownership before dispatch.
- [ ] [#dagdispatch] [recommended] Execute auto-DAG batches through agent-doc orchestrate/jobs: run parallel-safe antichain batches, collect worker_result proof, unblock downstream nodes only after required proof/session-check passes, and stop deterministically on failed/gated nodes without launching dependents.
- [ ] [#dagrecover] [recommended] Add auto-DAG persistence/recovery semantics: write operation docs/job packets with schedule id, node state, attempt count, replay commands, and repair commands so interrupted DAG runs can resume idempotently after compact/finalize/restart.
- [ ] [#daglogs] [recommended] Use session-review guardrails as scheduler input: classify prompt-budget/cache-resend/restart-loop/noop-closeout log families before auto-DAG start and gate large or looping runs into compact/restart/fixture-fix steps.
