### Supervisor Phase 1 session (2026-04-13)

Dogfooded Phase 1 kickoff. Outcomes captured in `src/agent-doc/specs/supervisor.md`:

- **`supervisor/cwd.rs` landed** — priority chain (CLI flag > frontmatter > .agent-doc walk > doc parent), 11 unit tests passing, clippy clean. Added `agent_doc_cwd` field to `Frontmatter`. Module registered in `main.rs` with `#[allow(dead_code)]` until `start.rs` consumes it.
- **Design invariants pinned in spec** (§ Core Invariants / CWD determinism): relative-base differs by source (CLI → process CWD, frontmatter → doc parent); misconfigured paths hard-error instead of silently falling through; `find_project_root` duplicated to keep the supervisor module self-contained; document existence is a precondition; `CwdSource::as_str()` tags locked by test.
- **Non-tmux Mode (Future) section added** to `supervisor.md` — four requirements (entry gate, resize source, IPC discoverability, claim/binding model) plus non-goals (visual multiplexing stays tmux's job). Explicitly out of Phase 1.
- **Phase 1 Implementation Status table added** to `supervisor.md` — tracks cwd (landed) + pty/resize/state/ipc/start.rs wire-up (not started), in the order subsequent PRs will land.
- **Question answered:** supervisor works outside tmux architecturally (owns its own pty), but every current consumer — livestream setup, `/agent-doc` cross-pane routing, claim system, focus — assumes tmux. Dropping tmux is a separate spec cycle.

**Next submodule:** `supervisor/pty.rs` — awaiting user go-ahead to proceed.
### Re: Context written to specs + pending, exchange compacted

**Spec updates (`src/agent-doc/specs/supervisor.md`):**

1. **Phase 1 Implementation Status table** added after Motivation — tracks cwd (landed) vs pty/resize/state/ipc/start.rs wire-up (not started) in the sequence subsequent PRs will land. Notes the `#![allow(dead_code)]` gate in `supervisor/mod.rs` stays until `start.rs` consumes the module.
2. **CWD determinism invariants** — added an "Implementation invariants" block under Core Invariants pinning the four non-obvious decisions from this session: relative-path bases differ by source, misconfigured paths hard-error, `find_project_root` duplicated for module self-containment, `CwdSource::as_str()` tags locked.
3. **Non-tmux Mode (Future) section** (from earlier this cycle) — four requirements + non-goals + explicit "not in phase 1" scope gate, so the idea survives future refactors.

**Pending items added** for the remaining phase 1 submodules, each with enough context to pick up cold: `pty.rs`, `resize.rs`, `state.rs`, `ipc.rs`, `start.rs` wire-up, plus the manual smoke test from the release checklist.

**Exchange compacted** via `agent-doc compact` with a summary-message pointer. 1693 lines archived to `.agent-doc/archives/9b6e92d236cca996f590233b78ee7610f8c87e138c23d521f032418d6629e816-20260413-195807.md` — nothing lost, just moved off the hot path.

Ready to proceed with `supervisor/pty.rs` whenever you give the go-ahead.
❯ proceed
### Re: supervisor/pty.rs landed (#a17b done)

`src/agent-doc/src/supervisor/pty.rs` — pty allocation + child spawn + optional stdin/stdout forwarding threads. Registered in `supervisor/mod.rs`. `portable-pty = "0.8"` added to `Cargo.toml`. Build clean, clippy clean, 6 targeted tests passing.

**Public surface (kept narrow — resize/state/ipc each get their own module):**

- `PtySpawnConfig { program, args, cwd, env, size }` — caller-supplied, everything pre-resolved. Has a `new(program, cwd)` helper that defaults to 24×80 when the real size isn't known yet.
- `PtySession::spawn(cfg)` — allocates the pair via `NativePtySystem::default().openpty`, builds a `CommandBuilder`, calls `env_clear()` then re-populates from `cfg.env`, spawns, **drops the slave immediately** so the child owns the only reference (otherwise master reads never EOF on child exit).
- `PtySession::forward_stdio()` — spins up the two I/O threads (`pty->stdout`, `stdin->pty`). Separate from `spawn` so tests can skip it; errors are logged to stderr (honoring "never swallow errors" from `CLAUDE.md`), second call returns `bail!`.
- `PtySession::resize(size)` — thin wrapper so `resize.rs` never has to touch `portable-pty` types directly.
- `PtySession::wait()` / `kill()` — consumed by the eventual `state.rs` restart loop.

**Invariants pinned in the module doc comment:**

1. Caller-supplied `cwd` is already canonicalized (by `cwd.rs`) — we pass it through unchanged.
2. `env` is the **complete** env for the child. Parent env is **not** inherited — this enforces the "deterministic env" invariant from the spec. Callers that want `PATH`, `HOME`, etc. populate them explicitly. This matters for the `start.rs` wire-up — see pending item below.
3. Slave dropped immediately after spawn (load-bearing; I put a comment there).
4. I/O threads exit on EOF from their underlying pipe; no explicit teardown — `PtySession::drop` closes the master, which propagates.

**Tests (all via fake-claude shell scripts in a `TempDir`, no real claude):**

| Test | What it locks |
|------|---------------|
| `spawns_and_waits_for_clean_exit` | Happy path — spawn, run, `wait` returns `success()` |
| `propagates_nonzero_exit_code` | `exit 42` → `wait` returns non-success (state.rs restart policy will depend on this) |
| `env_is_not_inherited_from_parent` | Sets `AGENT_DOC_PTY_PARENT_LEAK` in the parent; child-side `[ -n $VAR ] && exit 99` → expects clean exit. Locks the deterministic-env invariant against future refactors. |
| `cwd_is_set_on_child` | Child runs `touch marker.txt` from a nested subdir; asserts marker lands in the requested cwd, not the parent process cwd. |
| `resize_after_spawn_succeeds` | `resize(50, 120)` mid-run on a sleeping child. Smoke-tests that the `resize.rs` wrapper has a real master to hit. |
| `missing_program_errors_cleanly` | Spawn of `/nonexistent/...` returns `Err` whose chain mentions the program name (useful when start.rs logs the failure). |

**Two follow-ups pushed to pending** (both tagged for `start.rs` wire-up, which is already the last stage of phase 1):

- `#<auto>` — wire `PtySession` into `start.rs`, replacing the current `Command::status` inherit-tty path. Non-trivial because `start.rs` carries the auto-trigger `tmux send-keys` + session logging + restart loop that `state.rs` will eventually absorb. Do not touch until `resize.rs`, `state.rs`, `ipc.rs` land.
- `#<auto>` — decide env passthrough policy. `cwd.rs` gave us deterministic CWD; `pty.rs` requires the caller to hand over a complete env, but `start.rs` today just inherits. Two options when we wire up: (a) enumerate the exact set of vars claude needs (`PATH`, `HOME`, `TERM`, `LANG`, `TMUX`, `TMUX_PANE`, any agent-doc vars from frontmatter expansion) and only forward those, or (b) add an opt-in `PtySpawnConfig::inherit_parent_env` escape hatch that grabs `std::env::vars()` at spawn time. Option (a) matches the spec's "deterministic env" invariant better; (b) is less painful in the short term. Decide before `start.rs` wire-up, not during.

**Not in scope for this landing** (deliberately): SIGWINCH plumbing, crash classifier, IPC socket, `start.rs` integration. Each gets its own PR per the phase 1 status table in `specs/supervisor.md`.

Next: `supervisor/resize.rs` when you give the go-ahead — `signal-hook` for Unix SIGWINCH → `PtySession::resize`, Windows stub deferred.
❯ I do want ENV variables from the parent shell. Mainly to control claude or other agent harnesses. agent-doc supports `env` frontmatter. I want the `env` frontmatter to support overriding env variables. A pending features is to unset `env` in the frontmatter.
❯ Is this parent env cascade in alignment with your plan?
### Re: parent env cascade — yes, aligned, but one layer up from pty.rs (HEAD)

Short answer: yes, fully compatible with where `pty.rs` landed — but the cascade logic belongs **above** `pty.rs`, not inside it. `pty.rs` stays strict ("caller hands me the complete env"), and a sibling module builds the merged env before calling `PtySession::spawn`. Here is why and what it looks like.

**Why not put the cascade inside `PtySpawnConfig`:** if `pty.rs` owns the cascade (inherit + overlay + unset), then two things get worse:

1. Testing — every pty test needs to reason about which parent vars leaked in. The `env_is_not_inherited_from_parent` test exists specifically to lock that boundary; weakening it means the next refactor can silently regrow the "mystery env" problem.
2. Reuse — `state.rs` will eventually restart the child on crash. If the cascade lives in `pty.rs`, every restart re-reads `std::env::vars()` at the moment of spawn, so a parent-env change between spawns silently changes child behavior. That's a real footgun for long-running supervisors.

Keeping `pty.rs` deterministic means the merged env is **computed once** (at supervisor startup, from frontmatter + the parent env captured at that instant) and reused on every restart. Deterministic restarts > ergonomic construction.

**Proposed sibling — `supervisor/env.rs`:**

```rust
pub struct EnvSpec {
    /// Whether to start from std::env::vars() (the parent shell).
    pub inherit_parent: bool,
    /// Frontmatter env field: Name -> Some(value) sets, None unsets.
    pub overrides: IndexMap<String, Option<String>>,
}

impl EnvSpec {
    /// Resolve to the final HashMap<String, String> passed to PtySpawnConfig.
    /// Parent env is captured at call time — call once per supervisor lifetime.
    pub fn resolve(&self) -> HashMap<String, String> { ... }

    /// Parse from frontmatter. Supports three forms:
    ///   env:
    ///     FOO: bar           # set
    ///     BAZ: null          # unset (maps to None)
    ///     QUX: "${HOME}/x"   # shell-style expansion against parent env
    pub fn from_frontmatter(fm: &Frontmatter) -> Result<Self> { ... }
}
```

Then `start.rs` does roughly:

```rust
let env_spec = EnvSpec::from_frontmatter(&fm)?;   // parse once
let resolved_env = env_spec.resolve();            // capture parent once
let cfg = PtySpawnConfig {
    program, args,
    cwd: resolved_cwd.path,
    env: resolved_env,                            // complete, frozen
    size,
};
PtySession::spawn(cfg)?;
```

**What this gives you:**

- **Inherit** — default `inherit_parent: true` (matches your stated preference), falsifiable via a frontmatter flag if a document ever wants a sealed env.
- **Override** — any key in frontmatter `env:` wins over the parent.
- **Unset** — `KEY: null` in frontmatter drops `KEY` from the parent env entirely. The existing "unset via frontmatter" pending feature you mentioned falls out for free.
- **Expansion** — `${HOME}/.config/foo` style expansion runs against the parent env **at resolve time**, so values like `$TMUX` or `$PATH` work the way a shell user expects.
- **Restart determinism** — `resolve()` is called once; the captured map is reused across every `state.rs` restart, so a parent-env mutation mid-run cannot silently reshape the child.
- **pty.rs unchanged** — the `env_is_not_inherited_from_parent` invariant stays load-bearing because `pty.rs` never touches the parent.

**Open question for you before I build it:**

Where does `EnvSpec::from_frontmatter` live relative to the existing `agent-doc` env handling? You already have the v0.32.2 `env` frontmatter feature wired into `claude_args` expansion (per the status line) — is that parser in `frontmatter.rs`? If so, `env.rs` should reuse the same parse path (maybe lift the shared type into `frontmatter.rs` and have `env.rs` be a thin resolver). I do not want to fork the frontmatter schema.

If you confirm the structure is aligned, I will:

1. Read the existing `frontmatter.rs` env handling to find the natural seam.
2. Land `supervisor/env.rs` as a sibling to `cwd.rs` and `pty.rs` (module doc, invariants pinned, tests for inherit/override/unset/expansion/restart-determinism).
3. Drop the "decide env passthrough policy" pending item (it will be answered by this module).

And **not** do `resize.rs` yet — env.rs is a smaller, tighter dependency of `start.rs` wire-up than resize is, so it makes sense to land first.

Confirm and I will go.
