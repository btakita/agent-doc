## Status

<!-- agent:status patch=replace -->

Completed: #gdbpostbase, #gdbrowstream, #gdbprepstage, and #gdbenginegate shipped in tsift c0ebfd5 and superproject 851d29aad; #gdbvacproof is gated on missing live Convex transport credentials after local dry-run and compact proof.
<!-- /agent:status -->

## Spec

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog -->
- [ ] [#gdbrefreshcache] [recommended] Promote backend-eval source-watermark cached projection reuse into normal graph-db refresh/conflict-matrix paths: when code-index, session, and summary watermarks match, skip source_graph_build/projection_rows/sqlite temp/property staging and open the existing graph.db read-only; prove with three backend-eval samples covering real.sqlite.refresh, source_graph_build, sqlite_delta_write, and conflict-matrix timings.
- [ ] [#gdbtargetsnap] [recommended] Make conflict-matrix and dispatch-trace target-scoped instead of loading every graph_nodes/graph_edges row: build the snapshot from resolved targets, evidence paths, owned files/symbols, and direct conflict neighborhoods; keep full-graph snapshots behind an explicit diagnostic path and gate on real.sqlite.conflict_matrix plus dispatch_trace normalized metrics.
- [ ] [#gdbpathprobe] [recommended] Remove full-edge/full-row scans from backend-eval probe selection by adding GraphStore count and sample-edge APIs backed by SQLite COUNT(*)/LIMIT 1 queries, then retarget path_max_hops/status metrics so they measure SQLite graph operations rather than all_nodes/all_edges setup cost.
- [/] [#orchdog] [recommended] Dogfood the completed graph-backed agent orchestration stack on a real agent-doc queue run: run refresh -> evidence -> conflict-matrix -> dispatch-trace -> jobs create/collect, compare worker_prompt_packet and worker_result closure fields, and capture any tsift-side fixture gaps. **Dogfood performed 2026-05-21 on `session-share/tasks/root.md` items #x63e + #v4v0; findings recorded in #gdbevid, #cmgr, #gdbidx — see `session-share/tasks/root.md` exchange "graph-backed orchestration dogfood" entry for the full pipeline trace.** **Second dogfood 2026-05-21 against `tasks/software/tsift.md` (preset `#dogfood-tsift`) surfaced 2 new gaps: #cmgrwres and #gdblock.**

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#gdbvacproof] [recommended] Run the real Convex reconciliation plus graph-db compact workflow and capture before/after file size, freelist, tombstone counts, status/doctor timings, and scan-cost deltas so compaction policy is backed by operational evidence.
