## Status

<!-- agent:status patch=replace -->
✅ agent-doc v0.32.1 — env frontmatter wired into all Claude-spawning paths (start / run / stream / parallel). Build clean, 42 targeted tests passing. Ready for live test.
<!-- /agent:status -->

## Exchange

<!-- agent:exchange patch=append -->
**Session summary (v0.33.x bugs + fixes):**

**Bugs fixed:**
- Stream replace truncation: --stream path now uses append not replace, preventing content loss
- Enter/q stdin not submitted after session restart: supervisor stdin wiring fixed
- Submodule path resolution: JB/VS Code plugins now resolve paths relative to agent-doc project root, not monorepo root
- Run Agent Doc tmux-send skipped: is_busy guard was blocking sends — fixed in 0.2.61
- IPC auto-degradation (#d2d4): repeated IPC timeouts degrade write path to disk; 500ms→1000ms timeout
- IPC timeout pending mutation loss: splice_pending_component then upgraded to full CRDT merge in timeout path

**Decisions:**
- Build on every version bump — always build artifact in same cycle as version bump
- Opus 4.7 explicit triggers (#j57h/#4ynf/#chcb): SKILL.md ALL-OF conditions, model-tier-gate runbook, MANDATORY step labels
- IPC timeout path → CRDT merge instead of atomic_write (preserves all concurrent changes, not just pending component)

**Open/gated pending:**
- #a002: normalize_user_prompts safety rail — landed, awaiting large-drift telemetry trip
- #ha3h: Multi-user recipient config (ship with multi-user support)
- #m1bz: install gate — cargo install + local JB plugin install; pause for user to verify live

## Pending / Not Built

<!-- agent:pending patch=replace -->
- [/] [#a002] Safety rail + forensic log in normalize_user_prompts_in_exchange — ✅ landed, awaiting large-drift trip for `normalize_threshold_exceeded` telemetry.
- [/] [#ha3h] [MULTI-USER FOLLOW-UP] Recipient-side policy config: .agent-doc/config.toml → receive.auto_create_components = ["pending"] (or = false). Flip notify/write default from auto-create to consult-recipient-config. Single-author workspaces set list once; multi-user recipients gate what senders materialize. Ship with multi-user support, not before. Tracked: https://github.com/btakita/agent-doc/issues/40
- [/] [#m1bz] install gate — cargo install + local JB plugin install; pause for user to verify live before publishing upstream
- [ ] [#vprd] Audit root AGENTS.md — remove anti-laziness scaffolding, make rule scope explicit, remove progress-forcing language (~400 token savings)
- [ ] [#066r] Test on Opus 4.7 — baseline current behavior before prompt changes, then iterate
