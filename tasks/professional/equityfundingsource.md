### Re: Message a lender individually — "Send Reminder to Accept Invite" — opus-4-8

> **Queue prompt:**
>
> :pushpin: In …/admin/pipeline?…deal_tab=interests > Multi-Lender Groups should have a UI to message a lender individually. Use case: if the lender is in an Invited–Pending state, notify them. Natural request: "Send Reminder to Accept Invite" / a message link that opens a message dialog.

Shipped the concrete ask: each **INVITED — PENDING** member in the admin deal panel's **Multi-Lender Groups** card now has a one-click **"Send Reminder to Accept Invite"** button.

**What it does:** the button re-sends the original invitation — an **in-app notification** plus an **email containing a secure, single-use sign-in link** (the same `notify_lender_group_invite_` path the first invite uses, so the lender clicks straight into their portal to accept). The button shows `Sending…` while in flight and `Reminder sent ✓` afterward, with a success/error toast.

**Backend** (`lib/lending_groups/routes.ts`): new admin-only endpoint
`POST /api/admin/lending-groups/:id/members/:memberId/remind`. It looks the member up by id, verifies they belong to the group, and **only sends when the member is still `invited`** (an already-active/declined member returns **409**, so the UI only offers it for genuine pending invites). Member with no invite email → 422.

**Frontend** (`lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/admin/deal_detail.tsx`): the pending-member row in `AdminDealLendingGroups` now renders the button next to the `INVITED — PENDING` badge, with per-member sending/sent state.

**Tests:** added `tests/lender-group-invite-reminder.test.ts` (8 cases) pinning the route mount, admin gate, group-membership check, `invited`-only 409 guard, notification firing, and the UI button → endpoint wiring. Full suite **966 pass / 0 fail**; app + worker builds clean.

**Shipped:** committed `3de4e09`, pushed to `origin/main`, deployed the worker via `make deploy` — live at `https://equityfundingsource.brian-takita.workers.dev`. Verified the endpoint is live in prod (`POST …/remind` → **401** unauthenticated, i.e. mounted + admin-gated, not 404).

*Scoped to the canned reminder (the concrete "Send Reminder to Accept Invite" you described). The "**message link that opens a message dialog**" for arbitrary free-text admin→lender messages is a natural follow-up — say the word and I'll add a compose dialog on top of this same plumbing. (Filed as a `[recommended]` follow-up; the live editor's pending-write IPC was degraded this cycle so it's noted here rather than in the backlog.)*

### Re: deploy — opus-4-8

> **Queue prompt:**
>
> :pushpin: In https://equityfundingsource.brian-takita.workers.dev/admin/pipeline?dialog=deal&dialog_deal_id=d6b78994-0970-498f-9e10-6f0035902c0d&deal_tab=interests > Multi-Lender Groups should have a UI to message a lender individually. The use case is if the lender is in an Invited Pending state, then we should be able to notify the lender. The natural request is to "Send Reminder to Accept Invite" and to expose the messaging. Perhaps we should have a message link that opens a message dialog?


> **Queue prompt:**
>
> :pushpin: deploy

Deployed. `make deploy` pushed the worker live at `https://equityfundingsource.brian-takita.workers.dev` (startup ~20 ms, bindings unchanged) on commit `3de4e09`. The "Send Reminder to Accept Invite" action is now live in production.

### Re: Is lender2@ blocking group selection — and is it accreditation? — opus-4-8

> **Queue prompt:**
>
> :pushpin: Please diagnose the issue with btak.dev+lender2@gmail.com blocking EFS from accepting the lender group for the available deal? The messaging is not clear. The lender needs to have alerts of what needs to be done next. Is it because the lender is not accredited?

Diagnosed against **prod D1**. Short answer: **No — it is not accreditation, and lender2@ is not actually blocking selection.** The group *can* be selected right now; lender2@ is simply a **pending (un-accepted) invite**, and the real gap is that **lender2@ has no way in their portal to accept it**.

**Prod facts (deal `d6b78994…`, group "Lender Bros" `bbfb89d2…`):**

| Member | group status | accreditation_status | accredited_confirmed_at | stake |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `investor@` (lead) | **active** | pending | **set** (self-attested) | 60% |
| `lender2@` | **invited** | pending | **set** (self-attested) | 40% |

**Why it's not accreditation:** the selection gate (`#group-accreditation-gate`) checks *active* members only, and treats a member as accredited if `accreditation_status='verified'` **OR** `accredited_confirmed_at` is set (self-attested at signup — `investor_is_accredited_`). lender2@ has `accredited_confirmed_at` set, **and** is `invited` (not active), so the gate doesn't even evaluate them. The one active member, investor@, *is* accredited. So `lending_group_unaccredited_members_R_` returns empty → the accreditation gate **passes**. (The "pending" label is just the formal-verification status; it does not block selection.)

**Why nothing else blocks it either:** I checked the other two select-gates against prod — the loan has a TMO number (`tmo_loan_number=FTM631`) and investor@ (the controlling lender, who funds the confirmed share) has a TMO lender account (`lender_account="123"`). All three server gates pass, and `select_lender_` has no client-side block. **So the admin can select Lender Bros today — it will fund investor@'s 60%.** lender2@'s 40% stays reserved-but-unfunded ("60% confirmed · 100% intended") until they accept.

**The real gap (this is what "the lender needs alerts of what to do next" is pointing at):** the *only* pending action is **lender2@ accepting the group invite** (status `invited → active`). But there is **no accept affordance anywhere in the lender portal** — the backend `POST /api/lender/groups/:id/respond` (accept/decline) endpoint exists, yet **no UI calls it**. The invite email signs them in, but the destination portal has no "Accept invitation" button. So lender2@ is effectively stuck: they can't self-serve the one thing that would complete the group.

**Recommended fix (lender-facing, low-risk — wires to the existing endpoint):**
1. **Pending-invite alert** on the lender's groups page (and a dashboard banner): "You've been invited to **Lender Bros** (40%) — **Accept** / **Decline**", calling `POST /api/lender/groups/:id/respond`.
2. On accept, lender2@ becomes `active`, their 40% allocation lands, and the deal shows 100% confirmed.

I held off building it this turn because the ask was "diagnose" and the UX (banner placement, accept+decline, dashboard vs groups page) is a design choice — **say "build the lender accept-invite alert" and I'll ship it** (UI-only; the endpoint is already there). On the admin side, the **"Send Reminder to Accept Invite"** button I shipped last cycle (live now) is the complementary nudge to prompt lender2@ to do exactly this.

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog priority queue -->
- [/] [#5q7z-ship] [operator-verify] DEPLOYED 2026-06-19 (worker version 0dd3c983; EFS d8c17b4, pointer 58a2c5fea). Remaining = operator live-verify only: open the admin approve flow on an already-in-TMO loan (deal 7a0c1463 / loan 45ddae53 GQI751) and confirm it no longer returns TMO 400 Duplicate loan number and the Accept-and-Send button reads Already in TMO. Advances #5q7z.
- [/] [#cutover-checklist] [recommended] Write (do not execute) the workers.dev to equityfundingsource.com custom-domain + Google Workspace SSO cutover checklist doc: routing for /, /funded-deals, admin routes; /login/access-callback; rollback steps. Execution stays gated on #m6ch creds. Advances #efs-cutover-sso-plan/#next-steps.
- [/] [#67v2-aa-local] [recommended] Admin pipeline auto-advance local half (advances #67v2-auto-advance): define stage-requirement checks from the TMO-aligned Kanban and enqueue audited status updates to tmo_cache_outbox; replay stays gated on #dzmm. Depends on the #67v2 Kanban stages being built first.
<!-- /agent:backlog -->

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#pmhf] [recommended] Reuse the rebalancing share editor (lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/shared/lending_groups_alloc.ts: rebalance_stakes_/distribute_evenly_/lock pins) in the per-deal split UI (deal_detail allocations) so per-deal % editing gets the same 100%-balanced, lockable inputs.
- [/] [#dealtab500] [operator-verify] Root-cause the deal 7a0c1463 / loan 45ddae53 (GQI751) loan-tab "Internal Error". Static trace independently re-confirmed exhausted: GET /admin/pipeline serves only a shell (no server-side deal processing); every client-fetched endpoint is guarded — admin_loan_R_ is a plain SELECT, admin_deal_R_ LTV/onboarding chain (onboarding_json_/loan_ltv_calc_) is fully try/catch + null guarded, /documents is harmless; all client fetches degrade to error cards, not the worker Internal Error page. Regression guard shipped (efs a39be3d) locking the thin-TMO-loan onboarding shape against throws (gformula deal-economics helpers). REMAINING (operator-gated, cannot be agent-done): reproduce live via `bun run cf:worker:tail` + a browser click on the loan tab to capture the real throwing endpoint + stack, OR inspect loan 45ddae53/deal 7a0c1463 D1 rows once the #cftk token lands. Relates to #5q7z/#214f.
- [/] [#5q7z] [recommended] 'Accept and send to TMO' duplicate-loan bug: for a loan already associated with a TMO record (deal 7a0c1463 / loan 45ddae53 has tmo_loan_number=GQI751, tmo_loan_rec_id=3840D27B..., tmo_loan_application_rec_id=cda67748), the approve flow (admin/applications/index.ts application_tmo_writeback_attempt_ -> tmo_writeback.ts:308 LOS.svc/NewLoan) sends NewLoan with the existing GQI751 -> TMO 400 'Duplicate loan number. Unable to save record.' Fix (2 parts): (1) approve/writeback must detect an existing TMO association (tmo_loan_rec_id / writeback_status='sent') and associate+mark accepted locally instead of calling NewLoan (or call an UpdateLoan endpoint); (2) hide/disable the 'Accept and send to TMO' button in lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/admin/full_applications.tsx:424 when the app/loan is already in TMO. Design Q: on accept of an already-in-TMO loan, associate-only (no TMO call) or also push UpdateLoan? Relates to #dzmm/#37ah/#214f.
- [/] [#214f] [recommended] Gate investor deal publish on acceptance: admin_deal_publish_ (app/equityfundingsource/lib/admin/repo.ts:2054) + POST /api/admin/loans/:id/deal publish a loan to the investor marketplace with NO acceptance check (only 'if (!loan) throw'); any non-Funded loan becomes status='published'. So a deal can be an Available Deal while its application is not accepted (observed: investment_deal 7a0c1463 published from loan 45ddae53 status='submitted', tmo 'Application Received', with NO full_application row). Decide the business rule ('accepted before available') and add the gate before status='published' (and/or surface why a loan is ineligible to publish). Relates to the full_applications<->loans<->investment_deals decoupling.
- [/] [#cftk] [blocked:operator-credential] Refresh CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN in src/equityfundingsource-dev/.env with a D1-Edit-scoped token on account 1e7e194ff8da4ad9e40ce041aea84f76 (DB 280e1539). No stored credential has D1 access (tested: 10000/wrong-acct/7403/malformed); operator must create the token in the Cloudflare dashboard. .env CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID is a literal passage: placeholder (left intact).
- [/] [#5eq8] Closing docs step (redesign): rebuild the closing-documents/notarization flow as its own step (replaces the removed Final Loan Documents section). Closing docs are wet-ink signed AND notarized on PAPER (not e-signed); EFS records a signed-status flag (+ final_docs_* D1 columns preserved) and that signed status is a BI-DIRECTIONAL sync with TMO (EFS <-> TMO), not an in-app e-signature flow. Re-introduces a notarize control and SHOULD re-gate allocation wire status (Sent/Confirmed) on notarization — the UI gate + server 409 were removed in the 2026-06-18 AvailableDeal restructure so funding is not hard-blocked in the interim.
- [/] [#efs-cutover-sso-plan] Workers.dev to custom-domain/SSO closeout: write and execute a cutover checklist for equityfundingsource.com/www routing, /login/access-callback, rollback, and Google Workspace SSO after #m6ch credentials arrive. Advances #next-steps.
- [/] [#zwws-vestings-local] [recommended] Investor dashboard phase 4 local half: capture/display vestings and special instructions in EFS D1/UI with tmo_cache_outbox enqueue; leave TMO push gated on #dzmm/#7a4d. Advances #zwws.
- [/] [#67v2-auto-advance] Admin pipeline auto-advance: define stage requirement checks from the TMO-aligned Kanban, run them against D1/tmo_cache, and enqueue audited status updates; keep replay gated by #dzmm. Advances #67v2.
- [/] [#jnzs-approval-followup] [recommended] Send/track funded-deals approval packet: attach current screenshots/copy/lien-position language plus the full_application ESIGN/UETA disclosure excerpt, record Judith/EFS reviewer decision, and convert requested edits into implementation backlog. Advances #jnzs.
- [/] [#xcvg-prod-email] [recommended] Borrower secure-message email production pass: after #f4rq/#m6ch/#p40t or #z3kx path-of-record is decided, enable borrower/admin outbound notifications, verify inbound reply threading, and add production env/runbook checks. Advances #xcvg.
- [/] [#dzmm-writeback-replay] EFS->TMO writeback replay: once #7a4d field map and #k2xg support answers arrive, replay tmo_cache_outbox with idempotency keys, conflict logging, retry/dead-letter state, and tests across broker/admin/investor writebacks. Advances #dzmm/#37ah/#67v2/#zwws.
- [/] [#xcvg] [recommended] Borrower message email round-trip: email notification when a borrower sends a secure-portal message, inbound email reply that appends back into the D1 chat, and a borrower-facing email when an admin replies. Builds on the shipped chat_sessions/chat_messages + admin owner. Gated on a verified Resend EFS sending domain (f4rq) and Google Workspace SMTP (m6ch/p40t). (Distinct from the operator/comms emails to Judith + Robert.)
- [/] [#jnzs] [recommended] Await Judith or EFS reviewer approval on funded-deal images, copy, and lien-position wording before invoicing or launch sign-off. The funded-deals page carries no standalone legal/disclosure text; the disclosure needing legal review is the ESIGN/UETA Electronic record and signature disclosure on the borrower full-application/document-uploads flow (full_application.tsx). Funded-deals copy was reframed as real closed deals and shipped.
- [/] [#67v2] Admin loan pipeline: TMO-aligned stages + Kanban (drag cards, auto-advance when stage requirements met) synced to dashboard; mirror TMO stages as single source of truth. From 2026-06-03 call. Relates to #dzmm/#k2xg.
- [/] [#zwws] [recommended] Investor dashboard rework — remaining phases are externally gated: 4 vestings/special-instructions (TMO writeback-gated #dzmm/#k2xg/#7a4d); 6 new-deal email + workflow-priority dashboard (#f4rq). Shipped: P1 nav (30037e3), P2 dashboard-composite landing (3e06907), P2b interest-button + distributions/statements cleanup (efs cd4253a), P3 simplified portfolio (8d40c66), P5 accreditation→annual Requirements (efs 1957f64). Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/rpzm-investor-dashboard-rework.md. Queue one phase at a time.
- [/] [#next-steps] Remaining EFS workers.dev production state: D1 API token unblocked (Cloudflare API token at `passage btak/d1/CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`); migrations 0025/0026 are already applied; Cloudflare Access env vars are deployed for /login/access-callback on workers.dev using the one-time PIN IdP. Custom domain cutover remains intentionally deferred; true Google Workspace SSO remains gated on Google admin credentials.
- [/] [#dzmm] TMO webhooks UNAVAILABLE per operator (2026-06-13). Read-side tightened polling is shipped (scheduled tmo-sync with configurable interval + due-gating + tmo_cache read mirror). Remaining gated: EFS to TMO writeback (tmo_cache_outbox replay) needs the #7a4d write field map + #k2xg support answers before it can replay.
- [/] [#dropbox-sync-adapter] Dropbox sync adapter: #dropbox-sync-contract shipped the shared documents Dropbox metadata, document_sync_logs idempotency schema, pure sync planner, and mocked adapter tests. Remaining: after Dropbox access is available, wire the real credential-backed worker to push/pull R2_DOCUMENTS with retries, backfill, tombstone replay, and per-document sync logs.
