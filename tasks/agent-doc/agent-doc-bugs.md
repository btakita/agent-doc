<!-- agent:backlog -->
- [ ] [#refusalsteeringverbatim] [agent-doc] GH #75 secondary: preflight refusals warn operator steering 'may be waiting unanswered' but session-check lists no prompt verbatim when the edit sits inside an unmerged editor save; surface the divergent components' operator text (agent-doc-document-realtime-io — coordinate with the in-flight #rebasedsavefalsefail edit there)
- [ ] [#supdrainyieldfalsifiable] [agent-doc][recommended] GH #73 suggestion 3: record the supervisor-drain hand-off (session_check_supervisor_drain_handoff now logs head_sha256 + supervisor_drain_readiness) so the next preflight reports 'yielded N min ago, still undrained' instead of silently re-presenting the same heads
- [/] [#apimdrevert] [agent-doc][operator-verify] src/haiven-dev/tasks/api.md 'reverted by queue updates' (2026-09-29): forensics found NO lost operator text — disk/controller/editor converged at c9273a0b (HEAD 1b432940 + Codex 00:49:49 queue stop+strike, applied as a 2038-byte CRDT delta against the converged base). Only editor-side anomaly: idea.1.log 00:40:02
6local-splice-batch 3 splices 34346->34137 chars, then 00:40:03 exact inverse back to 25509a1e (undo/redo or plugin-internal flip; no VFS reload/projection logged). Blocked on operator: which text was lost + when (JetBrains Local History on api.md). Then trace the dropping path and fix with regression coverage.

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#drivecapturedsplice] [operator-verify] Captured-splice live proof (#activateinstalledjetbrai). LIVE RUN 2026-09-30 20:33Z (operator go-ahead): after harness fixes 01b1e30b7, the recipe drove IDEA end to end — edit one captured (editor_op_capture_proof operator_ops=37 shadow_replay=agreed, 20:33:01Z), canonical advanced independently via write --commit in owner pane %93 (20:33:02Z, editor acknowledged the target), edit two captured (operator_ops=36 agreed, 20:33:12Z); the final text holds every operator edit plus the advance. No text lost. The verifier still FAILS: its proving triple needs two source=captured-local-splice-recovery reads, and the plugin only takes that path (CrdtReplicaManager rebootstrapCanonicalAndForwardCapturedLocalEdit) when its replica is STALE against the canonical text. Healthy delivery reached the editor before edit two, so the recovery never had to run. DECISION NEEDED: (a) accept the healthy-path trail as the proof, extending verify-captured-splice-recovery with a capture/advance/capture triple, or (b) require the stale-replica race, making the recipe type edit two while the advance is still in flight. Aside: the scratch doc is under gitignored tmp/, so every advance ends commit_refused_ignored_path (write lands on disk, commit refused). Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-captured-editor-splice-recovery.md.
- [/] [#pypiquotarecheck] Track pypi/support#12214 (agent-doc project limit request, 25 GiB) to a decision. Unblocked mechanically by a human reply on pypi/support#12214, or 'make pypi-quota-check' reporting a ceiling in reach. Rechecked 2026-09-30 16:25 EDT: 8.362 GiB of 10.0 GiB, 1.638 GiB headroom, 158 releases (0.35.113..0.35.424), post-cutover mean 34.7 KiB, ~49,485 further releases fit; VERDICT headroom fine. Nothing to act on or delete. pypi/support#12214 still open, 1 comment (github-actions bot), untouched since 2026-09-10T22:46:21Z. If the grant lands, record it and drop this item. Deletion stays reserved for a ceiling the check reports (next tranche 0.35.113..0.35.161, 2.491 GiB); verify any deletion from the authenticated /manage/project/agent-doc/ pages, never from pypi.org/pypi/agent-doc/json.
- [/] [#grokmcpverify] [operator-verify] Verify an authenticated Grok Build MCP admit/read/plan/finalize cycle and same-turn auto-queue continuation. NEW BLOCKER 2026-09-30: grok 1.0.41 is now SIGNED OUT ('grok -p' -> 'Error: Not signed in'); operator runs 'grok login --device-code' (or sets XAI_API_KEY), and the free usage quota or the planned subscription must be active. Grok CLI authorization, native JSON/backend commit fixtures, pane detection and quit behavior passed earlier; the last live MCP probe stopped at the usage limit before committed closeout. Heavy is not required. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-grok-build-support.md.
