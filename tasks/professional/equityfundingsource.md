## Status

<!-- agent:status patch=replace -->

EFS commit 3ffcc32 pushed on 2026-06-12: admin full-application Step 4 subject-property fields are editable, extended subject-property fields persist, and admin edits are tracked in application_subject_property_change_logs with field-level old/new values. Verification passed: targeted tests, full make check, and clean committed-tree make check; GitHub CI workflow check is unavailable because this repo has no workflow named CI. Existing unrelated EFS local changes remain unstaged.

Implemented and pushed EFS commit 3ffcc32 (`feat(admin): edit subject property fields`). The admin full-application detail now has an editable Step 4 - Subject property card backed by `PATCH /api/admin/full-applications/:id/subject-property`.

Change history was not previously tracked for subject-property edits. It is now: migration `0061_application_subject_property_admin_history.sql` adds the extended subject-property columns plus `application_subject_property_change_logs`, and the admin endpoint records one history row per changed field with old value, new value, admin user, and timestamp. The Step 4 card also shows that history.

Verification passed: targeted `bun test tests/admin-subject-property-edit.test.ts tests/apply4-full-application-p5.test.ts tests/admin-full-application-approve-ui.test.ts`, full `make check`, and a second clean committed-tree `make check` after stashing unrelated local EFS edits. GitHub CI lookup is still unavailable because this repo has no workflow named `CI`. Existing unrelated EFS local changes were restored and remain unstaged.

### Re: Stripe account email — gpt-5

Draft email:

Subject: Stripe account setup for borrower payments

Hi Robert and Judith,

We are almost ready to launch the new Equity Funding Source website and portals. One of the last launch items is connecting Stripe so borrower payments can be tested safely first, then switched to live payments when you approve.

Please create or prepare an EFS-owned Stripe account for borrower payments.

Recommended Stripe setup path:

1. Create the Stripe account under the Equity Funding Source business name: https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
2. Complete Stripe's business verification and account checklist so the account can process live payments and receive payouts: https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/set-up
3. Add the payout bank account that should receive borrower payment deposits.
4. Enable the payment methods borrowers should be able to use. For the borrower portal, ACH Direct Debit is the most important option if you want bank-account payments; card payments can also be enabled if desired. Stripe's ACH setup reference is here: https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit
5. Use Stripe's sandbox/test mode first. Test mode uses separate API keys and simulated payments, so we can verify the borrower payment flow without moving real money. Stripe's API key guide is here: https://docs.stripe.com/keys
6. After testing is approved, switch to live mode and use the live API keys/webhook signing secret for production. Please do not send live secret keys by email; either invite me/the implementation team as a Stripe team member or share credentials through a secure password manager.

Items needed to finish the integration:

- A Stripe team invite for the implementation work, or secure access to the account.
- Confirmation on whether borrower payments should support ACH only, card only, or both ACH and card.
- Confirmation of the payout bank account and the customer statement descriptor borrowers should see.
- Approval before we turn on live borrower payments after the final test transaction passes.

Once the account is ready, I can connect the test environment first, run through the borrower payment flow, and then prepare the live switch for your approval.

Best,
Brian

<!--
Is there an admin for the borrower portal messages? Can we have an email notification whenever a borrow sends a message? Can we support an email response back into the chat? Can the borrower receive emails whenever an admin responds with a message?

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog -->
- [ ] [#efspgo] [recommended] EFS online-payment go-live config (after Robert provides Stripe account): set Cloudflare secrets STRIPE_SECRET_KEY + STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET + var STRIPE_PAYMENTS_ENABLED=true (wrangler secret put / wrangler.toml), point a Stripe webhook at /api/stripe/webhook, then in admin Platform Settings fill the borrower payment wire/ACH + lender ACH values and flip the per-method enable toggles.

- [ ] [#d1h2] OCR provider adapter: process private R2 documents through pluggable parsers starting with Ragie Parse or Workers AI/Claude where appropriate; keep original R2 object as source of truth and persist source page/bounding-box evidence.
- [ ] [#f5kq] OCR admin review workflow: show extracted fields with source evidence, confidence, and diffable approval/rejection before any TMO borrower, loan, lender, or loan-application writeback.
- [ ] [#ntcr] Search/index spike: keep D1/R2 canonical and evaluate Ragie index plus Cloudflare Vectorize/SQL edge tables before adopting Neo4j, FalkorDB, Convex, or another separate graph database.
- [ ] [#7a4d] [recommended] OCR/TMO field extraction: custom/fillable docs -> reviewed extracted fields -> TMO update/create flow

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#vd8s] [recommended] Investor Pipeline phase 2 — remaining after stalled-stage highlighting shipped (EFS 055a73c): drag-to-confirm-wire from the Committed lane (needs multi-pending-fund disambiguation) and TMO AddLoanFunding sync state in the Active lane once the writeback gate (#dzmm/#k2xg) clears. Per-investor activity timeline folds into the #vtx8 detail modal. Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/investor-pipeline-admin.md
- [/] [#67v2] Admin loan pipeline: TMO-aligned stages + Kanban (drag cards, auto-advance when stage requirements met) synced to dashboard; mirror TMO stages as single source of truth. From 2026-06-03 call. Relates to #dzmm/#k2xg.
- [/] [#zwws] [recommended] Investor dashboard rework — remaining phases are externally gated: 4 vestings/special-instructions (TMO writeback-gated #dzmm/#k2xg/#7a4d); 6 new-deal email + workflow-priority dashboard (#f4rq). Shipped: P1 nav (30037e3), P2 dashboard-composite landing (3e06907), P2b interest-button + distributions/statements cleanup (efs cd4253a), P3 simplified portfolio (8d40c66), P5 accreditation→annual Requirements (efs 1957f64). Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/rpzm-investor-dashboard-rework.md. Queue one phase at a time.
- [/] [#cm3e] [recommended] Borrower online payment collection (Stripe) + TMO sync: add ACH/card payment in the borrower portal make-payment section; on Stripe payment_intent.succeeded webhook, verify signature, record the receipt in a new EFS D1 loan_payment_transactions table, reconcile the matching loan_payments schedule row, and push the payment to TMO. GATE: confirm ABS/TMO exposes a borrower-payment/receipt WRITE endpoint (current docs/TMO cover loan/application writes, investor AddLoanFunding, and schedule/funding reads only) — ties into the TMO-writeback gate (dzmm/k2xg). Deferred non-MVP collection path from e245; handle KYC, partial payments, NSF reversals, fees.
- [/] [#xcvg] [recommended] Borrower message email round-trip: add an admin owner for borrower-portal secure messages, email notification when a borrower sends a message, inbound email reply that appends into the D1 chat, and borrower email when an admin replies. Builds on existing chat_sessions/chat_messages. Gated on Resend EFS sending domain (f4rq) + Google Workspace SMTP (m6ch/p40t).
- [/] [#next-steps] Remaining EFS workers.dev production state: D1 API token unblocked; migrations 0025/0026 are already applied; Cloudflare Access env vars are deployed for /login/access-callback on workers.dev using the one-time PIN IdP. Custom domain cutover remains intentionally deferred; true Google Workspace SSO remains gated on Google admin credentials.
- [/] [#37ah] [recommended] Broker portal backend: replace static broker demo data with TMO-backed submit-deal, pipeline, commissions, documents, and notifications
- [/] [#dzmm] TMO webhooks: confirm outbound webhook support (Robert to check with Mortgage Office)
- [/] [#qakx] Investor portal document pages: replace static Documents, Statements, and Accreditation fixture data with D1/R2-backed APIs and authenticated upload/request/download flows.
- [/] [#1v5m] Resolved 2026-05-25: created an EFS-specific Cloudflare API token scoped to account 1e7e194ff8da4ad9e40ce041aea84f76 with D1, Workers Scripts, R2, observability, and read-only user/account metadata permissions; updated passage btak/equityfundingsource/cloudflare_api_token. D1 migration list/apply now succeeds and reports no pending migrations.
- [/] [#jnzs] [recommended] Await Judith or EFS reviewer approval on funded-deal images, copy, lien-position wording, and legal/disclosure language before invoicing or launch sign-off. Technical D1 migration, Worker deploy, and live funded-deals/admin-route smoke tests completed 2026-05-23.
- [/] [#dropbox-sync-adapter] Dropbox sync adapter: after Dropbox access is available, push/pull R2_DOCUMENTS with idempotent retries, backfill, tombstone handling, and per-document sync logs.

## Completed / Reaped

<!-- agent:icebox -->
- [ ] [#e1kb] Point equityfundingsource.com and www.equityfundingsource.com at the Cloudflare Pages project equityfundingsource, then verify / and /funded-deals on the custom domain; if admin routes are expected on the custom domain too, decide whether to route those paths to the Worker or move the dynamic app fully behind the same hostname.
- [ ] [#z3kx] GoHighLevel CRM as messaging/notifications path of record (Robert's enterprise GHL); integrate with the site so notifications also surface in-app; avoid SendGrid/extra recurring fees. From 2026-06-03 call. Relates to #xcvg.
