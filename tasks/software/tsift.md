## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog -->
- [ ] [#agent-doc-domain-boundary] Extract a tsift-agent-doc domain crate for session-review, session-digest, session-cost, agent-doc log parsing, guardrails, and fixtures after the CLI command/domain boundary is small enough to keep rendering in tsift-cli.
- [ ] [#graph-neighborhood-budget] Improve graph and neighborhood queries with bounded scoring/caps so context packs return high-signal callers, callees, and nearby symbols without broad graph expansion.
- [ ] [#token-action-coverage] Add fixture-backed coverage for prompt_budget, cache_resend, and restart_loop next_token_actions so bounded session reviews avoid duplicate failure/action rows beyond the noop_closeout case.
