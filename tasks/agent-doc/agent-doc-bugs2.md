Active backlog:
- [ ] [#gitstage] [recommended] In the previous boost-client turn, the intended root superproject submodule-pointer bump was blocked by `fatal: Unable to create .../.git/modules/src/boost-client/index.lock: File exists` during `git add src/monsterrodholders-dev`, but a later root `git commit` still succeeded against pre-existing staged paths while leaving the intended submodule pointer unstaged. Fix plan only: reproduce the nested-submodule lock + dirty-index path, trace where the agent-doc closeout/commit workflow keeps going after a failed stage step, compare the requested path set with the actual staged diff before commit, and define a fail-closed rule so path-scoped closeout either (a) stages exactly the expected paths and commits only that set or (b) stops with actionable guidance instead of consuming unrelated staged changes. Plan: `tasks/agent-doc/plan-gitstage-path-scoped-commit-fail-closed.md`
- [ ] [#resyncflake] [recommended] Stabilize resync::tests::purge_unregistered_stash_panes_kills_retained_dead_stash_pane; cargo test sync:: hit it once even though the same test passed in isolation.
- [ ] [#vssplitreplay] [recommended] Replay the live VS Code mixed-root split (tasks/agent-doc/agent-doc-bugs2.md + src/session-share/tasks/claudescore-3.md) to confirm passive sync no longer stashes a healthy running pane.

- [ ] [#gitstage] [recommended] In the previous boost-client turn, the intended root superproject submodule-pointer bump was blocked by `fatal: Unable to create .../.git/modules/src/boost-client/index.lock: File exists` during `git add src/monsterrodholders-dev`, but a later root `git commit` still succeeded against pre-existing staged paths while leaving the intended submodule pointer unstaged.

Plan: `tasks/agent-doc/plan-gitstage-path-scoped-commit-fail-closed.md`
- [ ] [#resyncflake] [recommended] Stabilize resync::tests::purge_unregistered_stash_panes_kills_retained_dead_stash_pane; cargo test sync:: hit it once even though the same test passed in isolation.
- [ ] [#vssplitreplay] [recommended] Replay the live VS Code mixed-root split (tasks/agent-doc/agent-doc-bugs2.md + src/session-share/tasks/claudescore-3.md) to confirm passive sync no longer stashes a healthy running pane.
- [ ] [#rspcmt] [recommended] Previous response was written to
  `src/session-share/tasks/claudescore-3.md` but not committed. Create a fix plan only: reproduce the closeout path, trace where
  `finalize`/
  `write --commit` can report success without a persisted commit, identify any stash/sync/session-check interaction that can leave the response uncommitted, then add regression coverage and a fail-closed acceptance criterion so agent-doc never reports a completed closeout until the response commit is verifiably present.
- [ ] [#rprdrift] [recommended] `agent-doc repair` reported "No pending response found" for `src/boost-client/tasks/monsterrodholders.md` even though `session-check` still failed on a committed cycle with unresolved prompt-bearing user drift after a direct patchback. Fix plan only: reproduce the exact state transition where a committed cycle still has prompt-bearing follow-up edits, compare `repair`, `session-check`, `write --commit`, and `finalize --pending-done` behavior on that state, decide whether `repair` should automatically convert the drift into a recoverable finalize path or fail with the same actionable guidance as `session-check`, and add regressions plus a fail-closed invariant so repo/session repair never stops at a false "nothing to repair" result while the document remains blocked.

  `session_end` metadata closeout fix in
  `startup_miss.rs` and the routed-dispatch binding hardening in
  `route.rs`. Final child closed:
  `#tmuxcrash-rn2d`.
