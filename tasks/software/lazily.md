### Re: release queue dispatch — gpt-5 · 2026-10-12T13:49-04:00

Claimed and dispatched `#lzreleasepins`, `#lzcorecohort`, and `#lzagentdocartifactrefresh` to isolated workers. Because the queue-level `#spec-test-commit-push` preset is undefined, those workers are restricted to in-worktree work and evidence; they may not commit, push, install, release, or publish.

> **Queue prompt:** #release

**Deferred:** the release worker made no changes and took no outward action because the queued `#release` has no matching backlog/review item, while frontmatter defines `release` (without `#`) rather than `'#release'`. Define the intended `#release` preset or provide the exact release scope, and define `#spec-test-commit-push` or otherwise give explicit authorization for any commit, push, version bump, tag, publish, install, or release action.

### Re: #release — gpt-5 · 2026-10-12T13:52-04:00

> **Queue prompt:** #release

No release, publish, tag, version bump, install, commit, or push was performed. This malformed queue head is acknowledged as a no-op: `release` does not define the queued `#release`, no backlog/review item supplies its scope, and the inherited `#spec-test-commit-push` preset is undefined. Re-add a corrected, scoped directive after defining the intended presets and authorization.

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog priority queue -->
- [ ] [#lzreleasepins] After the other superproject sessions settle, update only the Lazily gitlinks to released commits, rerun the exact-revision interop gate, and push the intended pin commit without unrelated workspace changes.
- [ ] [#lzcorecohort] Implement Phase 6 of tasks/software/plan-lazily-core-beta.md after the profile, truth, compatibility, and consumer gates are green: build the immutable cohort/BOM verifier and reproducible pinned release workflows; require #lzreleasepins and #lzrustpublish where applicable.
- [ ] [#lzagentdocartifactrefresh] Regenerate the expired btakita/agent-doc artifact-purge audit/handoff, rerun both full and durability-only dry-run options, refresh counterpart-durability evidence and counts, then re-gate the destructive purge on explicit operator authorization without deleting artifacts.

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#lzcoreconsumers] Implement Phase 5 of tasks/software/plan-lazily-core-beta.md after #lzcoreclaims and the relevant facade work: fan out clean artifact-consumer tests, supported-toolchain matrices, generated support policy, and corrected quickstarts/schema claims.
- [/] [#lzcorecompat] Implement Phase 4 of tasks/software/plan-lazily-core-beta.md: Core API snapshots, native compatibility gates, negative self-tests, deprecation metadata, and module compatibility tests are complete in the listed isolated worktrees; blocked until Phase 1/3 are integrated first, explicit commit/integration authorization is supplied or #spec-test-commit-push is defined, Zig 0.15.2/0.16.0 formatters are available, and the Rust corrected-profile divergence is resolved and validated.
- [/] [#lzcorefacades] Implement Phase 3 of tasks/software/plan-lazily-core-beta.md: additive idiomatic Core facades and package-content/identity checks are complete for all candidate bindings in /home/brian/worktrees/agent-loop-lzcorefacades-20261012, with Kotlin/Go/C# correctly retaining canonical package locations; blocked until corrected Phase 1 is integrated first, explicit commit/integration authorization is supplied or #spec-test-commit-push is defined, and the unavailable Zig 0.15.2/0.16.0 formatting gate can be run.
- [/] [#lzcoreclaims] Implement Phase 2 of tasks/software/plan-lazily-core-beta.md: the spec evidence contract and all nine binding declarations/report generators are complete and pass the aggregate --require-all gate in isolated worktrees; blocked until explicit commit/integration authorization is supplied or the queue-wide #spec-test-commit-push preset is defined.
- [/] [#lzgenericreadmeincident] [operator-verify] Inspect accidental generated README rollup changes in /home/brian/worktrees/lazily-rs and /home/brian/worktrees/lazily-kt. Prior README cleanliness is unknown; restore only README.md if the two generated rollup changes were unintended, and preserve all unrelated dirty/untracked files.
- [/] [#lzcoreprofile] Implement Phase 1 of tasks/software/plan-lazily-core-beta.md: candidate Core profile registry, schema, generated views, dependency-boundary checks, and validation gates are complete and verified in /home/brian/worktrees/lazily-spec-lzcoreprofile-20261012; blocked until explicit commit/integration authorization is supplied or the queue-wide #spec-test-commit-push preset is defined.
- [/] [#lzcorebeta1] Execute Phase 7 of tasks/software/plan-lazily-core-beta.md only after #lzbetascope, #lzreleasepins, publication blockers, and two RC cohorts or the four-week freeze are green: qualify, publish, and announce the first per-binding Lazily Core Beta cohort.
- [/] [#lzambienttokenresolve] Refresh the point-of-use credential plan's stale evidence for src/agent-doc/Makefile: update the recorded preimage SHA-256 and hunk offsets by hand, then rerun make publish-credential-proof and make review-gate-status until #lzambienttokenresolve is blocked_fresh. Do not resolve or print credential values, apply the prepared patches, or invoke a real publisher. After evidence is fresh, re-gate on the remaining operator-only quiet-window application, Cargo/npm/PyPI credential rotations, and real interactive-shell name-only verification in tasks/software/plan-ambient-publish-token-point-of-use.md.
- [/] [#lzrustpublish] [operator-decision] Configure crates.io Trusted Publishing for lazily-hub/lazily-rs workflow release.yml; then tag and publish the prepared v0.59.0 commit ea2910d and verify crates.io. Blocked solely on the missing publisher configuration.
- [/] [#lzgithubbudget20] Set the btakita personal Actions product budget to $20/month with Stop usage enabled; retain $0 hard-stop budgets for Packages, Codespaces, Git LFS, and AI credits. NOT probeable from here by construction, and `make review-gate-status` now records it as `unprobeable` rather than re-measuring it every cycle: /users/btakita/settings/billing/actions and /users/btakita/settings/billing/usage both return 404 with a `user`-scope hint for this token, and the REST billing API exposes no payment-method field even with that scope. Actions execution itself is not blocked — recent agent-doc CI runs start and pass — so this is spend-limit hardening, not an outage. Blocked until a valid payment method is added to the personal GitHub account. No agent-executable slice.
- [/] [#lzagentdocartifactpurge] [operator-decision, btakita/agent-doc] Read-only audit with counterpart durability classification (commits 667eb4766, 434b32548) lives at src/agent-doc/tasks/agent-doc/artifact-purge-audit-2026-09-27/ and is confirmed the ONLY handoff on disk, so only one basis can be authorized. Run the plan from src/agent-doc with `python3 scripts/purge-actions-artifacts.py`; the destructive run is `--execute --authorize-deletion btakita/agent-doc --max-deletions 3000` and the 250 default cap otherwise aborts. TWO authorizable options, both re-proved by live dry run: (a) full plan — 2,666 artifacts (43.83 GB), 0 refused, 0 skipped; (b) `--durability durable` — 2,136 artifacts (34.83 GB), refusing exactly the 530 rows whose only counterpart is a PyPI file. Prefer (b): the prune floor is 0.35.113 and v0.35.119, the oldest PyPI-only-backed version, is only the THIRD live release above it, so option (a) additionally accepts that 9.01 GB rests on a thinner margin than version numbering suggests. 2,136 rows rest on GitHub release assets, which have not decayed. 571 artifacts are withheld at audit time and are never deletable. Hard deadline: the 7-day `--max-handoff-age-days` guard aborts the whole run after 2026-10-04T05:56:08Z unless the audit is regenerated or `--allow-stale-handoff` is passed; `make review-gate-status` imports that guard from the purge script and flips this gate to `evidence_stale` 24h BEFORE it expires rather than after. Blocked solely on explicit destructive authorization; no artifact has been deleted.
- [/] [#lzbetascope] [operator-decision] Approve final promotion of the candidate Lazily Core profile to Beta under tasks/software/plan-lazily-core-beta.md after #lzcoreprofile, #lzcoreclaims, #lzcorefacades, #lzcorecompat, #lzcoreconsumers, #lzcorecohort, #lzreleasepins, and publication blockers are green. The public promise remains: Lazily Core is Beta; Lazily Modules graduate independently.
