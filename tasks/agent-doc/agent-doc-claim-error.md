I got another agent-doc claim error.
When calling `Claim for Tmux Pane` on tasks/software/joinhandshake.md
![img.png](img.png)
### Claim error analysis (HEAD)

The claim itself **succeeded** — pane %110 was created for `joinhandshake.md`. The errors you see are resync warnings about 7 orphaned stashed panes that can't be returned to a visible window.

All 7 stashed panes (%104, %109, %106, %108, %102, %107, %111) are idle Claude sessions sitting at the `❯` prompt. They're pre-fix leftovers that accumulate because:
1. v0.27.0 correctly keeps them registered (doesn't deregister)
2. But resync has no way to return them — "no valid target found"
3. They stay in stash forever, growing the warning list

**Two-part fix needed:**
1. **Immediate:** Kill the 7 orphaned panes now
2. **Permanent:** Add auto-cleanup to resync — when a stashed pane has an idle Claude session and no document claim, kill it instead of keeping it registered

Want me to kill the orphaned panes and implement the auto-cleanup in resync?
