## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog -->
- [ ] [#gvis] Native graph visualization in tsift: upgrade traverse --format html from static lists into a useful GraphStore-backed symbol/dependency/semantic graph visualization with compiled CLI coverage.
- [ ] [#gsim] Native embedding-backed semantic similarity in tsift: persist concept/entity embeddings beside summaries or graph rows, add a nearest-related-concepts query surface, and keep model/API use behind explicit extract/index paths.
- [ ] [#gsem] Native LLM semantic graph extraction in tsift: project summarize entities, relationships, and concept labels into GraphStore semantic nodes/edges with freshness/provenance and compiled CLI coverage.
- [ ] [#atvp] Unblock crates.io publication for tsift by replacing the upstream git-only sift dependency, publishing a compatible upstream crate, or vendoring a small stable search adapter; rerun cargo publish --dry-run before enabling TSIFT_ENABLE_CRATES_PUBLISH.
- [ ] [#g6kf] Confirm the v0.1.42 GitHub release completes after the macOS x86_64 Actions runner leaves the queue; if it remains stuck, remove or replace that matrix target and retag a fixed release.
