### Re: Sitemap comparison + SEO safety for transition

**Test results** (staging is HTTPS only — http://50.28.2.199.nip.io redirects to https://):

| URL | Staging (nip.io) | Prod (monsterrodholders.com) |
|---|---|---|
| `/wp-sitemap.xml` | 301 → `/sitemap_index.xml` | **200** (WP core sitemap) |
| `/sitemap.xml` | 301 → `/sitemap_index.xml` | 301 → `/wp-sitemap.xml` |
| `/sitemap_index.xml` | **200** (Yoast SEO) | — |
| `robots.txt` Sitemap: | `/sitemap_index.xml` | *(none declared)* |

**Root cause of the divergence:** staging has **Yoast SEO** active and handling sitemaps at `/sitemap_index.xml`. Prod is using **WordPress core's built-in sitemap** at `/wp-sitemap.xml` with no Yoast (or Yoast's sitemap feature disabled). Yoast hooks `init` to take over `/wp-sitemap*` URLs and 301-redirect them to its own `/sitemap_index.xml`, which is why staging's `/wp-sitemap.xml` returns 301 instead of a sitemap index.

**The two sitemaps differ in more than URL:**
- Prod (core) lists 8 sub-sitemaps: posts, pages, products, category, post_tag, product_cat, product_tag, product_shipping_class.
- Staging (Yoast) lists 9 — all of the above **plus `author-sitemap.xml`**. Yoast includes author archives by default; core doesn't.

**SEO risk assessment for the DNS flip:**

1. **Indexed URLs**: whatever Google currently has indexed as the canonical sitemap is `/wp-sitemap.xml` (the only one that returns 200 on prod today). Since prod's robots.txt doesn't declare a Sitemap: directive, Google is either using Search Console submission or autodiscovery at `/wp-sitemap.xml` / `/sitemap.xml`. After the flip, staging's Yoast will 301 both of those to `/sitemap_index.xml` — Google follows 301s for sitemaps, so it will update its reference. **Short-term: no ranking loss, just a crawl refresh.**

2. **Author archives leak**: Yoast's `author-sitemap.xml` exposes author user slugs (typically `brookebrodack` or similar). This is a minor privacy/security footprint and an SEO no-op for a storefront. **Recommend disabling author archives in Yoast** (SEO → Search Appearance → Archives → Author archives: Disabled) before the flip, or excluding author-sitemap via Yoast filter. That also 404s `/author/<slug>/` pages, which is what you want for a commerce site.

3. **Search Console re-submission**: after the DNS flip, submit `https://monsterrodholders.com/sitemap_index.xml` in Search Console (or add `Sitemap: https://monsterrodholders.com/sitemap_index.xml` to robots.txt so Google autodiscovers it). This is the cleanest signal that the sitemap location has moved.

4. **Canonical domain**: current staging XSL stylesheet is protocol-relative (`//50.28.2.199.nip.io/...`) because Yoast generates URLs from the request `Host` header. Since `ProxyPreserveHost On` is set in the Apache vhost, after the DNS flip Yoast will automatically emit `monsterrodholders.com` URLs without any config change. **No action needed here**; the proxy already does the right thing.

**Do you need to "implement /wp-sitemap.xml"?** No — it already exists and already 301s to the Yoast sitemap. The question is whether you want to keep Yoast (staging's current state) or revert to WP core (prod's current state):

- **Keep Yoast** (recommended): richer sitemap, meta tags, breadcrumbs, Open Graph. Disable author archives. Re-submit `/sitemap_index.xml` to Search Console post-flip.
- **Revert to core**: deactivate Yoast on staging, flush rewrites (`wp rewrite flush`). Pro: sitemap URL matches what Google has indexed today. Con: you lose all of Yoast's other SEO features.

**My recommendation**: keep Yoast, disable author archives, and add `Sitemap: https://monsterrodholders.com/sitemap_index.xml` to robots.txt once the flip is done. Net SEO impact during transition: neutral to positive (Yoast generally improves schema markup and meta coverage vs core-only).

### Re: Livestream VOD trim

Noted — that's a manual post-production step on your end. I've left it in pending.

### Re: SEO report → private gist

Created as a secret gist:

**https://gist.github.com/btakita/f02a1aba87607629ca158c4098b4a39a**

Contents: full sitemap comparison table, root cause (Yoast vs WP core), structural diff, 4-point SEO risk assessment (indexed URLs, author archives leak, Search Console resubmission, canonical domain handling), recommendation, and action items. Local copy at `/tmp/monsterrodholders-sitemap-seo-report.md`.

Secret gists are unlisted but anyone with the URL can view — don't share the link publicly if any of the content is sensitive. Nothing in the report exposes credentials or internal infra beyond what's already in the task doc.

❯ /wp-sitemap.xml, /sitemap.xml, and /sitemap_index.xml all have 404s. Fix this.
### Re: Sitemap 404s — can't reproduce, need host (HEAD)

Just probed both hosts from here. Current reality:

| URL | prod (monsterrodholders.com → Flywheel) | staging (50.28.2.199.nip.io → our Docker) |
|---|---|---|
| `/wp-sitemap.xml` | **200** | 301 → `/sitemap_index.xml` |
| `/sitemap.xml` | 301 → `/wp-sitemap.xml` | 301 → `/sitemap_index.xml` |
| `/sitemap_index.xml` | **404** | **200** (Yoast) |

So only one URL on one host is currently broken (`/sitemap_index.xml` on prod), and that's expected — prod is still running WP core sitemaps via Flywheel, no Yoast. All three resolve cleanly on staging.

**Which host are you seeing all three 404?** A few possibilities:

1. **DNS cache / different network** — you may be resolving `monsterrodholders.com` to our Docker server (50.28.2.199) while Apache still has `ProxyPass` sending `/sitemap*` traffic to Flywheel upstream for that Host header. I just confirmed that from the server itself: `curl -H 'Host: monsterrodholders.com' http://localhost/sitemap_index.xml` 301s to prod, which 404s. If your machine resolves monsterrodholders.com → 50.28.2.199, you'd see: wp-sitemap→prod 200, sitemap→prod 301→wp-sitemap 200, sitemap_index→prod 404. Only one 404, not three.

2. **A third host I don't know about** — e.g. a laptop/local docker, a different preview URL, CF tunnel, etc. If so, tell me the host and I'll probe it.

3. **Browser cache / service worker** — unlikely for XML but possible if you previously hit these URLs and a SW cached a 404.

Can you paste the exact URLs (with scheme + host) you're hitting, or run this from the same machine you're testing on and share output:

```bash
for u in wp-sitemap.xml sitemap.xml sitemap_index.xml; do
  echo "=== $u ==="
  curl -sI "https://monsterrodholders.com/$u" | head -3
done
```

Once I know which host, the fix is straightforward:

- **Staging (nip.io)**: already fine, nothing to do.
- **Prod Flywheel `/sitemap_index.xml` 404**: this is the known Yoast-vs-core split we already discussed. Fix is either (a) install Yoast on prod (unlikely you want to touch the Flywheel site pre-flip), or (b) ignore it until DNS flip — post-flip the staging Yoast will handle all three URLs.
- **DNS-resolved-to-staging scenario**: I can add Apache rewrites on our Docker server so that when Host=`monsterrodholders.com`, `/sitemap_index.xml` is served locally by the container (Yoast) instead of being proxied to Flywheel. Would eliminate the 404 you'd see during a partial/split DNS state.

Let me know which host and I'll apply the actual fix.

- **Rotate DB passwords** — `MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD` + `MARIADB_PASSWORD` still on the previous values in `docker-compose.yml` / `.env`; update `wp-config.php`, `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`.
- **Sitemap 404 investigation** — awaiting host clarification from user; current evidence shows only prod `/sitemap_index.xml` returns 404 (expected, Yoast not installed on Flywheel).
- **Livestream VOD trim** — the Stripe settings dump segment still needs manual trim in post-production.
