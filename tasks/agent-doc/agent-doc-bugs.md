## Status

<!-- agent:status patch=replace -->
Prior frontmatter bug fix remains complete. New work this cycle is planning only: added a concrete reliability plan for the “response patchback not committed / no patchback cycle ran” failure family. The current diagnosis is that two bugs can surface as the same symptom: (1) fresh Codex sessions can miss the initial route trigger entirely, so `preflight -> write -> commit` never starts; (2) a write/IPC + snapshot save can succeed, but the cycle can still die before `commit_*`, leaving a visible uncommitted assistant patchback in the working tree.

- [/] [#ha3h] [MULTI-USER FOLLOW-UP] Recipient-side policy config: .agent-doc/config.toml → receive.auto_create_components = ["pending"] (or = false). Flip notify/write default from auto-create to consult-recipient-config. Single-author workspaces set list once; multi-user recipients gate what senders materialize. Blocked until multi-user workspace support exists; issue #40 explicitly says not to ship this before that prerequisite. Tracked: https://github.com/btakita/agent-doc/issues/40

## Completed / Reaped

- 2026-05-31 [#pbc1] Commit-boundary reliability for Codex/IPC sessions: fail closed when fresh-start route trigger never fires, and auto-resume commit when write/snapshot succeeded but commit boundary was interrupted. Plan: `tasks/agent-doc/plans/commit-boundary-reliability-codex-ipc.md`
- 2026-05-31 [#dtmc] scan_text_source parallelized via std::thread::scope in diagnose_cycle
- 2026-05-31 [#editor-buffer-state-ffi-debounce] [recommended] Replace `wait_for_stable_content`'s last-added-line/truncation heuristic with editor-authoritative buffer stability when an IDE plugin is attached. JetBrains and VS Code plugins should report normalized editor state through the FFI bridge to the Session Actor: canonical doc path/session, monotonic editor document version, dirty flag, last edit timestamp, optional save timestamp, optional buffer hash, and ideally current buffer content. Run requests should include the editor version/hash observed at click time so the Session Actor can detect edits after invocation, debounce until the version/hash is stable, and compute the diff against the exact stable editor buffer when available. If no editor state exists, fall back to whole-file content + mtime stability polling. This removes reliance on `extract_last_added_line`, which misses edits above the last inserted line, and reduces disk/snapshot/editor-buffer race classes seen in live IPC/JB/VSCode flows.
- 2026-05-31 [#lr-found-1] Phase 1: Add lazily-rs dependency + define graph types in agent-doc-orchestration/src/graph.rs (RunContext, slot/cell handles, compute closures, unit tests). Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plans/lazily-rs-integration.md
- 2026-05-31 [#lr-dedup-2] Phase 2: Deduplicate project_root_for_doc — consolidate 8+ find_project_root implementations into single graph slot. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plans/lazily-rs-integration.md
