### Re: #n529 JB reactive state mirror via FFI deltas — glm-5-2

**`#n529` (lazilystatesync3) — shipped + tested.** The JB plugin now holds a
per-document lazily-spec mirror graph that applies `agent_doc_state_subscribe`
snapshot/delta messages, so editor UI reads tracked cells reactively instead of
re-parsing the full projection JSON on every observed event. The binary stays
the authoritative graph (`#lazilystatesync2` already shipped); the plugin is a
thin mirror consumer.

**What landed (two repos):**

- **lazily-kt (conformance pin):** new `StateGraphMirror` + wire shapes
  (`WireSnapshot`/`WireDelta`/`WireDeltaOp`/`WireSubscribe`) matching
  `state_wire.rs` 1:1; `LazilyFFI.agent_doc_state_subscribe` + a
  `StateProjectionClient.refreshMirror()` delta path. Added the missing
  `kotlin("plugin.serialization")` so the `@Serializable` shapes generate
  serializers. 32 gradle tests green, including the defining property: *cold
  snapshot of full state* converges identically to *partial cold + delta*.
- **JB plugin 0.2.189 → 0.2.190:** `AgentDocLib.agent_doc_state_subscribe`
  JNA binding; plugin-local `StateGraphMirror.kt` (Gson, Kotlin 1.9) pinned to
  the lazily-kt tests via `#lzpkgwire`; `StateProjectionBridge.subscribeMirrorForFile`
  advances the mirror and `mirrorSummaryForFile` derives `MirrorProjectionSummary`
  (routeReadiness / routePaneId / transportPhase / proofMarkers) from tracked
  cells. Legacy `projectionSummary(json)` kept as cold-read fallback. 9 plugin
  tests green (6 new mirror conformance tests).

**Known gap → `#n529b`:** the reactive summary is *available* but not yet read by
the dispatch-ready / busy consumers (`PromptPoller`, `RunAgentDocAttemptLedger`
still pull the cold path). That ECSM consumption + live dogfood is the next
focused phase — no gate on `#n529`, the substrate is shipped and builds clean.

**Operator action — JB plugin install:** rebuild ready at
`src/agent-doc/editors/jetbrains/build/distributions/agent-doc-jetbrains-0.2.190-signed.zip`.
Since `NativeLib.kt` gained a JNA symbol, please **uninstall → restart →
install → restart** (structural class change). No Rust binary change needed —
`agent_doc_state_subscribe` FFI already exists.

**Process note:** the prior `finalize` wedged on editor-IPC `no_ack` (`#6b5h` —
no live JB editor acknowledging in this OpenCode session) and leaked two orphan
fragment lines at the exchange top; recovering via `write --force-disk --commit`.

A recent monsterrodholders.md session had much churn after I edited the queue while a turn was running. One churn item included deleting a queue item that I added
---
agent-doc reentrant run on equityfundingsource.md had recovery churn.
```
● The recovery is complete and fully consistent. The binary converged the now-drained queue (empty block, queue_active:
  false), no_changes: true, both responses are committed in the session doc, and both code deliverables are on
  origin/main. The auto-loop terminated naturally.

  Let me record the specific recovery path for this failure mode, since it's a recurring dogfooding pattern

- [ ] [#qloop1] #agent-doc-feature Define durable queue loop annotation syntax and parser/rendering behavior: mark loop-only queue/backlog entries, keep annotation/state out of prompt completion proof, and expose a stable current-item marker for editor/supervisor surfaces.
- [ ] [#qloop2] #agent-doc-feature Implement idle-loop scheduling for annotated loop items: when normal drainable queue work is empty, dispatch loop items in deterministic sequence, persist the loop cursor/last-run state, and prove regular queue items always preempt loop work.
- [ ] [#qloop3] #agent-doc-feature Add loop poll controls: global default poll period plus per-loop override, next-run time gates, bounded backoff/jitter, and tests proving no tight spin when there are no relevant events.
- [ ] [#qloop4] #agent-doc-feature Add event-aware loop scheduling: record deterministic event counters/timestamps and let loop items schedule earlier/later based on event frequency before any model-assisted scheduling hook.
- [ ] [#qobs1] #agent-doc-feature Add a bounded observer telemetry snapshot surface: supervisor/session actors expose compact per-document state (cycle phase, queue head, actor readiness, IPC inflight, recent typed ops-log markers, and artifact handles) without dumping raw transcripts by default.
- [ ] [#qobs2] #agent-doc-feature Implement deterministic observer rules that scan session-check/preflight/ops-log snapshots for annotated issues and recurring failure patterns, then file deduped session-doc backlog bugs with evidence paths and stable issue fingerprints.
- [ ] [#qobs3] #agent-doc-feature Add a sidecar observer agent-doc loop that can monitor all running project sessions from snapshot artifacts, rate-limit bug filing, avoid pane interference, and route created bug items to the correct session document or a configured observer inbox.
- [ ] [#qobs4] #agent-doc-feature Add model-assisted observer triage as advisory-only: feed compact snapshot/context-pack handles to a subscription or local model, require deterministic evidence before auto-filing bugs, and record model provenance/confidence on suggestions.
- [ ] [#qlm1] #agent-doc-feature Define queue item backend-selection syntax for local-model execution, separate from queued `/model <tier>` switches: support explicit per-item backend/model annotations on normal and loop queue items without changing prompt text or completion proof.
- [ ] [#qlm2] #agent-doc-feature Implement a local-model queue dispatcher backend that can run eligible queue/loop items through a configured local model, capture stdout/structured results, and write responses through the normal agent-doc closeout boundary.
- [ ] [#qlm3] #agent-doc-feature Add local-model dispatch safety gates and telemetry: capability checks, GPU/resource lease integration, fallback policy, provenance logs, and tests proving local-model queue items cannot be silently marked complete without a committed response/proof.
