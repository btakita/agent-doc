### Re: is [#rtsw] done? — opus-4-8

Yes — done (marked `[x]`). The goal (get `opencode-tsift` publishing working and automated) is fully achieved, though the *mechanism* ended up different from what #rtsw originally proposed:

- #rtsw assumed the fix was a **granular npm token**. That turned out wrong — the `btakita` account enforces 2FA-bypass, so classic *and* granular tokens both hit `E403` (verified locally and in CI). Tokens are a dead end for this account.
- The actual resolution was **OIDC trusted publishing** (no token at all): `opencode-tsift@0.1.63` bootstrapped to npm, `npm trust` configured (`btakita/tsift` → `release.yml`, verified via `npm trust list`), `release.yml` switched to OIDC (`id-token: write`), and the dead `NPM_TOKEN` secret deleted.

Net result: every future `v*` release auto-publishes opencode-tsift via OIDC — no token, no OTP, no authenticator app. The npm-related review items (`#0y9e`, `#astnav-npm`, `#npm-auth-setup`) are effectively satisfied by this too; `#npm-publish-verify`'s last piece (a CI OIDC publish) will exercise itself on the next version bump.

## Queue

<!-- agent:queue preset="#spec-test-build-install-commit-push" -->
- Should we have separate sqlite databases for the community cache and other caches to avoid writer lock contention? Is the writer lock contention even an issue with WAL?
- is [#rtsw] done?

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#7qky] [recommended] Reduce Codex redundant runbook reads. SHIPPED (v0.34.0 unreleased): retain-don't-reread nudge in shared SKILL Runbooks source -> regenerated all harness surfaces; contract-safe. GATED on re-measurement: re-run 3-harness redundant-read analysis after Codex sessions accumulate with nudge live, compare to baseline (Claude 11.4% / Codex 12.6% / OpenCode 5.3%). If Codex rate doesn't drop, build enforcement as a session-scoped content-dedup LEDGER in a shared LEAF crate (depends on nothing in graph; tsift + agent-doc + others depend down onto it -- NOT inside tsift or agent-doc, avoids dependency cycle). Core = register(id,hash)/should_deliver(id,hash)->Full|Stub, exemptions via hash-change + compaction; session-id passed in by harness (agent-doc cycle_state.rs adapter); thin per-consumer integration. Design tsift-runbook + agent-doc seam to call this ledger from day one. NOT a Claude-only PreToolUse Read hook.
- [/] [#trt1] [recommended] Findings graph layer: add authored Finding/Decision/Note nodes to GraphStore, anchored by stable symbol-handle/tagpath edges (not line numbers), with provenance+confidence+freshness fields gated on community_graph_watermark for staleness; expose retrieval via context-pack/search injection and a / graph-menu command; opt-in/passive capture from agent-doc session archives; md/html as on-demand projection, graph store as source of truth. Spec in src/tsift/SPEC.md.
- [/] [#0y9e] I set NPM_TOKEN="$(passage btak/NPM_TOKEN)". Publish to npm.
- [/] [#astnav-npm] Configure NPM_TOKEN + TSIFT_ENABLE_NPM_PUBLISH secrets, publish opencode-tsift to npm (medium)
- [/] [#surreal-batch-bfs] #surreal-batch-bfs-gated: Batch frontier expansion - gated (low)
- [/] [#surreal-fixture] Record SurrealDB samples in graph-db-performance-history.json fixture (medium)
- [/] [#surrealbulk-close] Close #surrealbulk review item: re-run benchmarks, update SPEC.md benchmark table, mark done
- [/] [#rankdefault] Promote ranked_neighborhood into default graph lookup/context-pack/evidence output only after quality gates pass; compare ranked vs unranked output on real backlog/code queries for useful-hit density, duplicate-name precision, handle coverage, latency, and emitted tokens.
- [/] [#surrealbulk] Batch SurrealDB projection load: replace per-row upsert loops with bulk/transactional row load plus one-pass secondary-index rebuild; measure refresh/load separately.
- [/] [#full-e2e-verify] In fresh project: opencode plugin opencode-tsift && opencode then /tsift-status. On success mark #e2e-install done.
- [/] [#npm-publish-verify] After auth configured, tag release and verify publish-opencode-plugin CI job succeeds and opencode-tsift appears on npmjs.org
- [/] [#npm-auth-setup] Configure NPM_TOKEN secret + TSIFT_ENABLE_NPM_PUBLISH=true variable in GitHub repo settings
- [/] [#e2e-install] Verify end-to-end install: fresh opencode project + opencode plugin opencode-tsift + /tsift-status
