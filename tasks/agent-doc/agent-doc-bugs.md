## Status

<!-- agent:status patch=replace -->
✅ agent-doc v0.32.1 — env frontmatter wired into all Claude-spawning paths (start / run / stream / parallel). Build clean, 42 targeted tests passing. Ready for live test.

### Supervisor Phase 1 session (2026-04-13) (HEAD)

Dogfooded Phase 1 kickoff. Outcomes captured in `src/agent-doc/specs/supervisor.md`:

- **`supervisor/cwd.rs` landed** — priority chain (CLI flag > frontmatter > .agent-doc walk > doc parent), 11 unit tests passing, clippy clean. Added `agent_doc_cwd` field to `Frontmatter`. Module registered in `main.rs` with `#[allow(dead_code)]` until `start.rs` consumes it.
- **Design invariants pinned in spec** (§ Core Invariants / CWD determinism): relative-base differs by source (CLI → process CWD, frontmatter → doc parent); misconfigured paths hard-error instead of silently falling through; `find_project_root` duplicated to keep the supervisor module self-contained; document existence is a precondition; `CwdSource::as_str()` tags locked by test.
- **Non-tmux Mode (Future) section added** to `supervisor.md` — four requirements (entry gate, resize source, IPC discoverability, claim/binding model) plus non-goals (visual multiplexing stays tmux's job). Explicitly out of Phase 1.
- **Phase 1 Implementation Status table added** to `supervisor.md` — tracks cwd (landed) + pty/resize/state/ipc/start.rs wire-up (not started), in the order subsequent PRs will land.
- **Question answered:** supervisor works outside tmux architecturally (owns its own pty), but every current consumer — livestream setup, `/agent-doc` cross-pane routing, claim system, focus — assumes tmux. Dropping tmux is a separate spec cycle.

**Next submodule:** `supervisor/pty.rs` — awaiting user go-ahead to proceed.

## Pending / Not Built

<!-- agent:pending patch=replace -->
- [ ] [#a001] 🔴 Investigate boundary/baseline divergence root cause — `out_of_band_write` always-on log line landed (`git.rs:286`); aggregate after 1 day.
- [ ] [#a002] Safety rail + forensic log in normalize_user_prompts_in_exchange — ✅ landed, awaiting large-drift trip for `normalize_threshold_exceeded` telemetry.
- [ ] [#a004] Drop Option B (skill-side submodule workaround) — A handles it deterministically; B redundant.
- [ ] [#a005] Investigate 1062 pre-existing `❯` lines across 46 snapshots — legitimate or prior corruption?
- [ ] [#a006] Investigate duplicated `/agent:exchange` closing marker — likely same class as mass-prefix bug.
- [ ] [#a010] PostToolUse hook for agent-doc write (layer 3, optional).
- [ ] [#a011] End-of-cycle write invariant — warn if `preflight_diff_start` without `ipc_write_attempt`.
- [ ] [#a012] Expose `agent-doc session-check <FILE>` — nonzero if last ops.log entry is `preflight_diff_start`.
- [ ] [#a013] SPEC.md breakup — flat `specs/*.md` mechanical extraction.
- [ ] [#a014] Session drift: `registered panes span 2 tmux sessions: 1, 4` — resync if recurring.
- [ ] [#gqep] Release v0.32.4: bump Cargo.toml + pyproject.toml, VERSIONS.md entry for pending system, publish crates.io + GitHub Release after manual-testing gate
- [ ] [#14z4] Hash collision ceiling: implement 8-char fallback in pending::generate_hash if 4-char collides (spec §1)
- [ ] [#bak5] Optional: pending-done archive component for history trail (spec §3 step 3, deferred)
- [ ] [#mchh] Install rebuilt agent-doc-jetbrains plugin + verify Refresh Environment session picker end-to-end
- [ ] [#4sh0] Add planned-move logging to sync.rs reconciler so ClaimAction→SyncLayout pane swaps are debuggable
- [ ] [#xzz5] Preflight slash-command parser: absolute paths like /home/... get captured as commands. Require [a-z][a-z0-9:_-]* after the slash and reject tokens containing a second /.
- [ ] [#64mb] Investigate double commit_staging race: ops.log at 1776095605 shows two back-to-back commit_staging/out_of_band_write pairs for the same file within the same second.
- [ ] [#tw4a] claim: cd into document's .agent-doc root (nearest git repo) when claiming a pane. Fixes relative-path ambiguity and makes git ops naturally target the correct repo.
- [ ] [#8jzg] claim --isolate: spawn a fresh Claude Code process in the submodule root so CLAUDE.md, memory, and skills load scoped to that repo. Only real fix for cross-project context leakage (mid-session cd does not reload context).
