### Re: batch closeout for ipclegacyfix, ipcpluginalready, ipcfilehashskip — opus-4-7

All three queue items landed. Submodule d899c92, superproject 2a7116db8, both pushed. JB plugin 0.2.131 zips signed + unsigned built. ipclegacyfix migrated test fixtures from the legacy backlog component name to the canonical one (31+4 sites; 30 tests recovered). ipcfilehashskip adds response-only hash-skip in src/write.rs try_ipc fallback. ipcpluginalready adds FFI v2 listener with already_applied ack; JB plugin uses v2 with lastApplyWasNoOp detection. Verification clean (2358 unit pass plus pre-existing parallel-execution flakes that pass when run alone; integration suites all green except 1 pre-existing pane-recursion test unrelated to this work). Next queue head: jbrsrbusysw.

JB `Restart Supervisor Process` error:
```
agent-doc command failed (exit 1): Error: session_restart refused for /home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/tasks/agent-doc/agent-doc-bugs2.md because the authoritative actor is still starting and the document changed after the last committed cycle. Wait for a dispatch-ready prompt (`prompt_ready=true`) and retry, or run `agent-doc session status /home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/tasks/agent-doc/agent-doc-bugs2.md` to inspect the pane.

## Pending / Not Built

<!-- agent:backlog -->
- [ ] [#jbrsrbusysw] SimWorld scenario coverage for session_restart --force: route + Restart Supervisor while pane is alive-busy with and without --force, asserting the new refusal message and force success (including session_restart_busy_pre_interrupt_idle and session_restart_busy_force_killed event variants). Substantial — requires new Op variant + tmux/session_actor mock in src/sim_world.rs. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-jb-restart-supervisor-busy-refusal.md phase 4 (SimWorld piece).
- [ ] [#jbrsrbusyide] JB plugin IDE-side telemetry for session_restart --force: surface session_restart_force_used, session_restart_busy_pre_interrupt_idle, and session_restart_busy_force_killed events in the IntelliJ notification area or Logcat so users can see the recovery path the binary took. Kotlin work in editors/jetbrains/. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-jb-restart-supervisor-busy-refusal.md phase 4 (IDE piece).
- [ ] [#planperphase] Convention: split multi-phase plans into per-phase backlog IDs (e.g. #crdtrespfx1, #crdtrespfx2) instead of one parent ID that gets pending-gated. Lets queue auto-strike honor per-phase progress. Lower priority — the convention is opt-in for authors. [recommended]
- [ ] [#jbccfix] Fix the Compact Exchange write/cache boundary so JetBrains never receives a stale or conflicting file-cache snapshot after compact exchange.
- [ ] [#jbccreg] Add deterministic regression coverage for Compact Exchange cache-conflict handling, including stale snapshot and concurrent user-edit cases where feasible.
- [ ] [#jbccdocs] Document the Compact Exchange File Cache Conflict recovery path in the JetBrains/harness runbooks after the behavior is fixed.

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#jbrsrbusy] [partial] Phase 1 (binary) landed: agent-doc session restart <FILE> --force flag accepts alive-busy panes, refusal message now ends with the --force hint citing the exact command, and the force path logs session_restart_force_used. Plan phases 2 (JB plugin confirm dialog → invokes --force), 3 (optional harness-aware pre-interrupt with 2s idle wait), and 4 (SimWorld coverage + IDE-side telemetry) split into #jbrsrbusyjb, #jbrsrbusyint, and #jbrsrbusysim. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-jb-restart-supervisor-busy-refusal.md.
- [/] [#stuckcycledup] [recommended] [partial] Wedged-cycle pattern: cycle_already_committed gate now refuses the short-circuit when the active capture body is absent from HEAD (flow/closeout.rs::cycle_already_committed + new stuck_captured_cycle helper), and preflight emits a stuck_captured_cycle warning. Remaining plan parts split into #stuckcycleorphan, #stuckcyclerepair, and #stuckcyclesuperseded. Plan: tasks/agent-doc/plan-stuck-cycle-causes-duplicated-uncommitted-response.md.
- [/] [#jbresstart] Refuse cross-file pane rescue and extend Starting-actor wait after stash recovery; see tasks/agent-doc/plan-jb-route-rescued-stash-pane-starting-actor.md
