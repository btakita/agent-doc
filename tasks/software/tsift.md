## Queue

- Please create a plan for local model support for Knowledge Graphs. Add tasks to the backlog and queue. Read my current 5090 usage and prioritize the optimal local model for my machine. Make sure the Knowledge Graph can work with both tsift and agent-doc via tsift-* library. We should be able to support multiple runs. Make sure the vRAM is cleared when not needed.

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog priority queue -->
- [ ] [#vmax] [operator-verify] Enable crates.io OIDC publishing for tsift (advances review #1td4; code already shipped in fe4144b/f29f7a2, release.yml crates job uses rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action@v1). Operator-gated steps (need crates.io account + browser 2FA — agent cannot perform): (1) On crates.io register a Trusted Publisher for EACH of the 23 tsift crates — GitHub repo btakita/tsift, workflow release.yml, no environment: tsift-core, tsift-md-ast, tsift-graph, tsift-sqlite, tsift-algorithms, tsift-resolution, tsift-cache, tsift-tokensave, tsift-libsql, tsift-index, tsift-summarize, tsift-quality, tsift-agent-doc, tsift-digest, tsift-search, tsift-status, tsift-session, tsift-memory, tsift-memgraphrag, tsift-surrealdb, tsift-cli, tsift, tsift-sim-world. (2) Enable the gate var: gh variable set TSIFT_ENABLE_CRATES_PUBLISH --body true. (3) Force-move the v0.1.70 tag to HEAD and push to re-trigger; confirm the publish-crates.io job authenticates via OIDC (no CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN) and publishes.

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#1td4] Release infra: crates.io publish job in .github/workflows/release.yml is MIGRATED to OIDC trusted publishing (commit fe4144b, on origin/main f29f7a2; uses rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action@v1, id-token: write, no CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN). Code complete. Remaining is operator-gated and tracked as actionable backlog #vmax: register the Trusted Publisher per crate on crates.io (23 crates), set repo var TSIFT_ENABLE_CRATES_PUBLISH=true, then re-tag v0.1.70 to verify OIDC publish. Stays gated until operator completes crates.io registration.
