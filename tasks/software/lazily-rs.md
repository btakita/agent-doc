## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog queue -->
- [ ] [#vbyc] Phase 2 (#rdstrat2): inline small-Copy seqlock cached-read fast path for ThreadSafeContext (the SPEC's ErasedValue idea) — size+Copy conditional, needs a Loom/Shuttle model before landing. Plan: tasks/software/plan-lazily-0.10-read-strategy.md [recommended]
- [ ] [#9mhz] Phase 3 (#rdstrat3): release lazily 0.10.0 (runtime-selectable read strategy + inline seqlock; default flips to LowConcurrency) — gate on user confirm for crates.io publish. Plan: tasks/software/plan-lazily-0.10-read-strategy.md [recommended]
