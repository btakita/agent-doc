# Versions

agent-doc is alpha software. Expect breaking changes between minor versions.

Use `BREAKING CHANGE:` prefix in version entries to flag incompatible changes.

## 0.4.0

- **`agent-doc claim <file>`**: New subcommand — claim a document for the current tmux pane. Reads session UUID from frontmatter + `$TMUX_PANE`, updates `sessions.json`. Last-call-wins semantics. Also invokable as `/agent-doc claim <file>` via the Claude Code skill.
- **`agent-doc skill install`**: Install the bundled SKILL.md to `.claude/skills/agent-doc/SKILL.md` in the current project. The skill content is embedded in the binary via `include_str!`, ensuring version sync.
- **`agent-doc skill check`**: Compare installed skill vs bundled version. Exit 0 if up to date, exit 1 if outdated or missing.
- **SKILL.md updated**: Fixed stale `$()` pattern → `agent-doc commit <FILE>`. Added `/agent-doc claim` support.
- **SPECS.md expanded**: Added §7.7–7.13 (all commands), §8 Session Routing with use case table (U1–U11), §8.3 Claim Semantics.

## 0.3.0

- **Multi-session prompt polling**: `agent-doc prompt --all` polls all live sessions in one call, returns JSON array. `SessionEntry` now includes a `file` field for document path (backward-compatible).
- **`agent-doc commit <file>`**: New subcommand — `git add -f` + commit with internally-generated timestamp. Replaces shell `$()` substitution in IDE/skill workflows.
- **Prompt detection**: `agent-doc prompt` subcommand added in v0.2.0 (unreleased).
- **send-keys fix**: Literal text (`-l`) + separate Enter, `new-window -a` append flag (unreleased since v0.2.0).

## 0.1.4

- **`agent-doc upgrade` self-update**: Downloads prebuilt binary from GitHub Releases as the primary upgrade strategy. Falls back to `cargo install`, then `pip install --upgrade`, then manual instructions including `curl | sh`.

## 0.1.3

- **Upgrade check**: Queries crates.io for latest version with a 24h cache. Prints a one-line stderr warning on startup if outdated.
- **`agent-doc upgrade`**: New subcommand tries `cargo install` then `pip install --upgrade`, or prints manual instructions.

## 0.1.2

- **Language-agnostic audit-docs**: Replace Cargo.toml-only root detection with 3-pass strategy (project markers → .git → CWD fallback). Scan 28 file extensions across 6 source dirs instead of .rs only.
- **--root CLI flag**: Override auto-detection of project root for audit-docs.
- **Test coverage**: Add unit tests for frontmatter, snapshot, and diff modules.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- **Interactive document sessions**: Edit a markdown document, run an AI agent, response appended back into the document.
- **Session continuity**: YAML frontmatter tracks session ID, agent backend, and model. Fork from current session on first run, resume on subsequent.
- **Diff-based runs**: Only changed content is sent as a diff, with the full document for context. Double-run guard via snapshots.
- **Merge-safe writes**: 3-way merge via `git merge-file` if the file is edited during agent response. Conflict markers written on merge failure.
- **Git integration**: Pre-commit user changes before agent call, leave agent response uncommitted for editor diff gutters. `-b` flag for auto-branch, `--no-git` to skip.
- **Agent backends**: Agent-agnostic core. Claude backend included. Custom backends configurable via `~/.config/agent-doc/config.toml`.
- **Commands**: `run`, `init`, `diff`, `reset`, `clean`, `audit-docs`.
- **Editor integration**: JetBrains External Tool, VS Code task, Vim/Neovim mapping.
