### Re: editor switching and recent logs — gpt-5.5

I reviewed the recent Claude Score artifacts, Codex log, agent-doc ops/session logs, current session status, and `tasks/agent-doc/plan-project-controller-session-actor-mvp.md`.

The strongest issue is still editor sync/focus latency, not dispatch to the active `agent-doc-bugs2.md` pane. Recent `ops.log` entries show repeated `sync_latency` overruns: earlier safe-passive syncs spent about 3s in `sync_lock_wait`, 1.3-2.1s in `prune_stash_panes`, and about 5.2-6.0s in `safe_passive_total` against a 1s budget. Later churn improved the lock wait to 100ms, but it is still logged as over budget and repeats during selection changes. Route dispatch itself looks healthy for this document: `%268`, generation 113, ready state, direct submit about 356ms, and `dispatch_start_proof` consumed in 1ms.

There is also a stale sibling-session problem: `tasks/software/tsift.md` is still recorded as actor generation 69, pane `%273`, state `starting`, while the supervisor is healthy and the last transition was `2026-05-08T18:53:45Z`. That mismatch can make editor-document switching feel wrong because one document has an authoritative ready actor and another visible document is still treated as starting. This is the exact class of bug where tmux layout heuristics and actor lifecycle facts disagree.

The Codex log is noisy with repeated plugin/skill manifest warnings, mostly invalid plugin default prompts and icon paths. I do not see those as the cause of the tmux switching delay. The Claude Score bootstrap artifacts do show calibration issues to keep tracking: the latest report passes `calibration_none <= 5%`, but reliability is poor in the 0.2-0.3 and 0.7-0.8 confidence bins, sentiment is under-scoring overall, and `claude-code/version-management` is the max divergence. The pytest `lastfailed` cache also still lists old scoring-api failures, so it is not clean evidence by itself.

Yes, deferred work in `tasks/agent-doc/plan-project-controller-session-actor-mvp.md` would fix the switching issue. The most relevant pieces are Phase C, which makes supervisors report lifecycle facts like ready/busy/blocked instead of leaving a healthy session stuck in `starting`; Phase D, which moves start/route/sync onto controller authority and makes tmux-router only reconcile layout; and the performance guardrails that budget `sync_latency` phases and make over-budget editor paths visible. Phase E then adds better editor diagnostics when a pane is stale, blocked, or accepted-but-unproven.

I added the top backlog item as `#editorswitch`. It should be first because it turns the deferred controller work into the user-visible invariant: switching editor documents should quickly focus the correct tmux pane even when another session is stale or sync/prune work is slow.

`❯ The current tree has already started making this accountable...` had the `❯ ` prefix stripped during the patchback. This issue keeps on reoccurring. Is the logic too brittle? Is the selection criteria opt out? If yes, can we make the criteria opt in instead?

"❯ Commit / push:" should not have the `❯ ` prefix since this was the agent response. #agent-doc-bug

Please optimize the AGENTS.md + SKILL.md to reduce context usage yet maintain effectiveness for Claude Code + Codex

Does the supervisor actor ever block on `Run Agent Doc`? I noticed that /home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/tasks/software/tsift did not respond to `Run Agent Doc` in a previous turn. It seems to run ok now but I'm concerned that `Run Agent Doc` was non-responsive.

## Pending / Not Built

<!-- agent:backlog -->

- [ ] [#editorswitch] Implement a bounded editor-document switch fast path: resolve the focused markdown file through the controller actor binding, update tmux focus without waiting on stale safe-passive sync/prune work, and add regressions for stale starting sibling sessions like tasks/software/tsift.md.
<!-- /agent:backlog -->

<!-- /agent:icebox -->

## Completed / Reaped

<!-- agent:pending-done -->
- 2026-05-07 [#backlogreap] [recommended] Make completed/reaped backlog items visible in the session document or closeout response so items like #commenttail, #tmuxcoord, and #coordspike do not look silently removed after --pending-done.
- 2026-05-07 [#sqliterepros] [recommended] Before prototyping .agent-doc/state.db, capture 2-3 current agent-doc failures where cross-file authority drift or non-atomic state writes would have been fixed by one transactional store rather than by the single-owner actor/supervisor model alone.
- 2026-05-07 [#sqliteeval] [recommended] Review plan tasks/agent-doc/plan-sqlite-session-store-concurrency.md against the single-owner actor rollout and decide whether to prototype .agent-doc/state.db as the authoritative session store.
- 2026-05-07 [#pcperf] [recommended] Add sync/route latency instrumentation and budgets to the Project Controller rollout: measure prune/proof/router/dispatch-ack phases, keep no-op safe-passive sync on the fast path, and surface when a 10s dispatch-proof wait is the reason a pane appears non-responsive.
- 2026-05-07 [#pcctrl] Implement Phase A from tasks/agent-doc/plan-project-controller-session-actor-mvp.md: add the project-local controller shell, singleton socket/launch lock, lazy connect-or-launch helper, controller status command, and bootstrap epoch/launch-mode persistence without changing route/start behavior yet.
- 2026-05-08 [#pcstore] Implement Phase B from tasks/agent-doc/plan-project-controller-session-actor-mvp.md: move actor-record load/store behind controller commands, write SQLite first, emit session-actors.json and sessions.json as projections, and add projection drift diagnostics.
- 2026-05-08 [#pcsuper] Implement Phase C from tasks/agent-doc/plan-project-controller-session-actor-mvp.md: make Harness Supervisor startup register with the controller and report ready/busy/waiting-input/blocked/closed lifecycle facts through controller-owned actor transitions.
- 2026-05-08 [#pcroutes] Implement Phase D from tasks/agent-doc/plan-project-controller-session-actor-mvp.md: convert start, route, and sync to read/dispatch through controller authority and keep tmux-router as layout reconciliation only.
- 2026-05-08 [#pcops] Implement Phase E from tasks/agent-doc/plan-project-controller-session-actor-mvp.md: wire status/history/attach/restart/clear/doctor through controller clients, keep destructive recovery behind doctor --repair, and expose stage-specific editor diagnostics.
- 2026-05-08 [#ctrlreload] [recommended] Add controller binary-generation/version invalidation so agent-doc restarts a stale project controller after local install/update instead of surfacing unknown controller command errors for newly-added controller RPCs.
- 2026-05-08 [#ctrlsock] Implement tasks/agent-doc/plan-controller-stalled-client-start-hang.md: make project controller RPCs robust to stalled clients so a stuck sync/no-autostart or closed prior pane cannot make agent-doc start/session status hang; fail closed with stale-pane diagnostics instead.
- 2026-05-08 [#tigertest] [recommended] Create a TigerBeetle-inspired deterministic simulation/property-test plan for agent-doc: model session-cycle state, generate concurrent document edits and crash/fault schedules, assert closeout/pending/git invariants, and keep most cases in fast pure tests.
- 2026-05-08 [#closeguard] Implement tasks/agent-doc/plan-closeout-active-prompt-guard.md: fail closeout when a committed response is followed by a newer unresolved prompt-bearing exchange line or when the matching pending item has a malformed checklist prefix.
- 2026-05-08 [#tigersim] [recommended] Implement Phase 1-2 from tasks/agent-doc/plan-tigerbeetle-style-simulation-testing.md: inventory pure closeout seams, build the first SimWorld closeout simulator, and promote fixed seeds for recent closeout/pending/snapshot bugs.
- 2026-05-08 [#tigerfault] Implement Phase 3 from /home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/tasks/agent-doc/plan-tigerbeetle-style-simulation-testing.md: add deterministic crash and fault injection points around snapshot save, fallback patch write, IPC delivery, template merge, working-tree write, index update, git commit, post-commit boundary reposition, and session-check.
- 2026-05-08 [#harnessprompt] Implement tasks/agent-doc/plan-harness-prompt-no-changes-closeout.md: make harness-native agent-doc turns fail closed when preflight reports no markdown changes but the chat prompt contains actionable text that was never persisted to the exchange.
- 2026-05-08 [#tigerroute] Implement Phase 4 from /home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/tasks/agent-doc/plan-tigerbeetle-style-simulation-testing.md: extend SimWorld with route/controller schedules, session actor generations, supervisor lifecycle facts, dispatch acceptance/proof, stale/missing pane observations, and projection-drift invariants.
- 2026-05-08 [#tigerci] Implement Phase 5 from /home/brian/work/btakita/agent-loop/tasks/agent-doc/plan-tigerbeetle-style-simulation-testing.md: wire fast fixed-seed simulator coverage into cargo test, add a wider deterministic make check budget if runtime stays acceptable, document seed-range replay/promotion, and track generated-coverage runtime budgets.
- 2026-05-08 [#autosync] Implement Phase 1 from tasks/agent-doc/plan-editor-autosync-latency-test-budget.md: fix editor selection autosync so changing focused markdown files applies the same tmux pane/focus result as manual Sync Tmux Layout, with editor and CLI regressions.
- 2026-05-08 [#synclag] Implement Phase 2 from tasks/agent-doc/plan-editor-autosync-latency-test-budget.md: capture slow manual sync runs, split sync/controller latency buckets, keep warm-controller safe-passive sync under budget, and surface the exact over-budget phase.
- 2026-05-08 [#tmuxbudget] Implement Phase 3 from tasks/agent-doc/plan-editor-autosync-latency-test-budget.md: inventory slow tmux-backed edge tests, keep only real tmux smoke coverage, and migrate pure ownership/controller schedules into deterministic SimWorld traces with runtime-budget tracking.
- 2026-05-08 [#syncproof] [recommended] Reduce safe-passive proof overhead after lock acquisition: cache cheap controller/session facts for unchanged editor selection, avoid repeated ownership proof on no-op syncs, and keep controller_actor_lookup plus ownership_proof inside explicit latency budgets.
- 2026-05-08 [#syncprune] [recommended] Shorten no-op prune work: skip or incrementally rate-limit stale/stash pane pruning when the active file/session mapping is unchanged, and keep prune_stash_panes under its 250ms subphase budget.
- 2026-05-09 [#synclock] Coalesce editor autosync and manual Sync Tmux Layout requests so routine selection churn does not wait the full 3s sync_lock_wait budget; make redundant safe-passive syncs join, supersede, or fail fast with a visible over-budget phase.
