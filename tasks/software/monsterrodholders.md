### Re: Sitemap comparison + SEO safety for transition

**Test results** (staging is HTTPS only — http://50.28.2.199.nip.io redirects to https://):

| URL | Staging (nip.io) | Prod (monsterrodholders.com) |
|---|---|---|
| `/wp-sitemap.xml` | 301 → `/sitemap_index.xml` | **200** (WP core sitemap) |
| `/sitemap.xml` | 301 → `/sitemap_index.xml` | 301 → `/wp-sitemap.xml` |
| `/sitemap_index.xml` | **200** (Yoast SEO) | — |
| `robots.txt` Sitemap: | `/sitemap_index.xml` | *(none declared)* |

**Root cause of the divergence:** staging has **Yoast SEO** active and handling sitemaps at `/sitemap_index.xml`. Prod is using **WordPress core's built-in sitemap** at `/wp-sitemap.xml` with no Yoast (or Yoast's sitemap feature disabled). Yoast hooks `init` to take over `/wp-sitemap*` URLs and 301-redirect them to its own `/sitemap_index.xml`, which is why staging's `/wp-sitemap.xml` returns 301 instead of a sitemap index.

**The two sitemaps differ in more than URL:**
- Prod (core) lists 8 sub-sitemaps: posts, pages, products, category, post_tag, product_cat, product_tag, product_shipping_class.
- Staging (Yoast) lists 9 — all of the above **plus `author-sitemap.xml`**. Yoast includes author archives by default; core doesn't.

**SEO risk assessment for the DNS flip:**

1. **Indexed URLs**: whatever Google currently has indexed as the canonical sitemap is `/wp-sitemap.xml` (the only one that returns 200 on prod today). Since prod's robots.txt doesn't declare a Sitemap: directive, Google is either using Search Console submission or autodiscovery at `/wp-sitemap.xml` / `/sitemap.xml`. After the flip, staging's Yoast will 301 both of those to `/sitemap_index.xml` — Google follows 301s for sitemaps, so it will update its reference. **Short-term: no ranking loss, just a crawl refresh.**

2. **Author archives leak**: Yoast's `author-sitemap.xml` exposes author user slugs (typically `brookebrodack` or similar). This is a minor privacy/security footprint and an SEO no-op for a storefront. **Recommend disabling author archives in Yoast** (SEO → Search Appearance → Archives → Author archives: Disabled) before the flip, or excluding author-sitemap via Yoast filter. That also 404s `/author/<slug>/` pages, which is what you want for a commerce site.

3. **Search Console re-submission**: after the DNS flip, submit `https://monsterrodholders.com/sitemap_index.xml` in Search Console (or add `Sitemap: https://monsterrodholders.com/sitemap_index.xml` to robots.txt so Google autodiscovers it). This is the cleanest signal that the sitemap location has moved.

4. **Canonical domain**: current staging XSL stylesheet is protocol-relative (`//50.28.2.199.nip.io/...`) because Yoast generates URLs from the request `Host` header. Since `ProxyPreserveHost On` is set in the Apache vhost, after the DNS flip Yoast will automatically emit `monsterrodholders.com` URLs without any config change. **No action needed here**; the proxy already does the right thing.

**Do you need to "implement /wp-sitemap.xml"?** No — it already exists and already 301s to the Yoast sitemap. The question is whether you want to keep Yoast (staging's current state) or revert to WP core (prod's current state):

- **Keep Yoast** (recommended): richer sitemap, meta tags, breadcrumbs, Open Graph. Disable author archives. Re-submit `/sitemap_index.xml` to Search Console post-flip.
- **Revert to core**: deactivate Yoast on staging, flush rewrites (`wp rewrite flush`). Pro: sitemap URL matches what Google has indexed today. Con: you lose all of Yoast's other SEO features.

**My recommendation**: keep Yoast, disable author archives, and add `Sitemap: https://monsterrodholders.com/sitemap_index.xml` to robots.txt once the flip is done. Net SEO impact during transition: neutral to positive (Yoast generally improves schema markup and meta coverage vs core-only).

- **Test Venmo button (if possible)** — ask a team member or tester to click the Venmo button and confirm approval flow; or check modsec audit log for zero 933120 hits on `form_encoded` when attempted. (blocked by: user password reset)
- **Rotate DB passwords** — `MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD` + `MARIADB_PASSWORD` still on the previous values in `docker-compose.yml` / `.env`; update `wp-config.php`, `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`.
- **Livestream VOD trim** — the Stripe settings dump segment still needs manual trim in post-production. (user action)
- **Decide on real shipping strategy** — Free Shipping is fine for testing; when going live, add Flat Rate / carrier rates above it.
- **Bump PPCP plugin 3.4.1 → 4.0.2** — defer until checkout is confirmed working end-to-end.
- **Disable Yoast author archives** — SEO → Search Appearance → Archives → Author archives: Disabled (removes `author-sitemap.xml` and `/author/<slug>/` pages before DNS flip).
- **Add Sitemap: directive to robots.txt** — `Sitemap: https://monsterrodholders.com/sitemap_index.xml` (post-flip, once cert is on real domain).
- **Re-submit sitemap to Google Search Console** — submit `https://monsterrodholders.com/sitemap_index.xml` after DNS flip so Google updates its canonical sitemap reference from `/wp-sitemap.xml`.
