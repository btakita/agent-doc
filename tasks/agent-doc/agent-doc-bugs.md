## Status <!-- agent:status patch=replace sync="##sync-release" -->

Main is at `b6b9af6e15` and agent-doc 0.35.532 is installed locally. Release v0.35.532 was published from `71f9801b49`. Post-release main now includes the inline-code-safe, occurrence-ordered queue preset authorization fix for GitHub issue #331 and the positive-evidence-only Remote Dev pane-order fix for GitHub issue #332; both issues are closed, the integrated full suite passed, and the current mainline was installed locally.

<!-- status:sync -->
Released and published agent-doc v0.35.556 from release commit `5cbfdbbc4c`; tag `v0.35.556` is the stable latest release (GitHub Latest, PyPI 0.35.556, stable target channels). JetBrains classic/262/263 0.2.839/0.2.841/0.2.840, VS Code 0.2.83. It adds onboarding Getting started, the queue marker legend, the component-marker fences (live edit, cold start, JetBrains edit-time warning), row-aware editor attach, reliable echoed-head strikes beside a loop queue, doctor/autofix exit codes, and pane-process launches for start/route/fan-out. GH #378 closed; GH #379 stays open pending Remote Dev proof (todo `#gh379-remotedev-proof`). Post-release `origin/main` is `0b226ee6d5` (unreleased, installed locally): the in-IDE restart-required prompt (JetBrains 0.2.842/0.2.844/0.2.843), no-argument `/agent-doc` on all four harnesses via `agent-doc document`, `agent-doc queue repair-stale-completion`, id-less `agent:run` / `agent:loop` named by kind (`run` / `loop`), the GH #376 measured route now publishing after its own surface Sync, and a test + spec pinning that the done/backlog free-text strike skips claimed rows.

### Re: session resumed after /clear — opus-5 · 2026-10-26T18:10-04:00

**Previous session's workers:** all ten finished before the clear, and their work is on `main`. Nothing was in flight, so nothing needed adopting.

**Dispatched this cycle (2), both 🚧 running in their own worktrees under `~/work/btakita/agent-doc-wt/`:**

- `do [#decisionbacklogstrike]` → `subagent:decisionbacklogstrike` (`analysis/decision-backlog-strike`). This is an analysis, not a change. It covers what a backlog strike does today, what closing claimed free-text rows would do to the claim, the worker, its unintegrated report and any request packet, the hazards ranked, safer variants such as striking only ☑️ rows or only `do [#id]` heads, and a recommendation. It will not implement "yes", because that's your call.
- `/agent-doc` with no arguments → `subagent:noargparity` (`feat/skill-no-arg-parity`). It builds on the earlier `noargskill` worker's unintegrated commit `81c3de55d5`, which already resolves the pane's claimed document. The worker rebases it onto `main`, which it is 26 commits behind, then checks each harness (Claude Code `/agent-doc`, a plain Codex `agent-doc` message, Grok Build, OpenCode) to confirm the bare form gets the same admission, contract, and closeout as the `<FILE>` form, and closes any gaps.

**`#fixautoupgrade`:** the 17:39 response before compaction answered your questions (re-qualify safety, re-qualify vs GH #339, and the serialization cost of Shrink). It's in the archive. The row stays Deferred until you pick what to queue. My recommendation is unchanged: keep the restart prompt as the fallback (done), start the GH #339 shell, and keep moving `TerminalUtil`/`PatchWatcher` behind the native library. Moving `CrdtReplicaManager` should wait for a per-keystroke latency benchmark.

**Leftover claims:** `autoupgrade`, `cellrepair` and `noargskill` are ☑️ claims owned by the cleared session. Their work is done and is waiting on your decisions, so I left them alone. Releasing them, as preflight suggested, would dispatch finished work again.

**Decisions for you:**
- Command names: `agent-doc queue repair-stale-completion` (cellrepair) and `agent-doc resolve-pane-document`, used by the no-arg work. The no-arg worker keeps the current name and will suggest alternatives.
- `#fixautoupgrade`: which follow-up to queue.
- Restart IntelliJ IDEA 2026.3 to load plugin 0.2.843.

### Re: do [#decisionbacklogstrike] — opus-5 · 2026-10-26T18:29-04:00

> **Queue prompt:** do [#decisionbacklogstrike]

**Decision (yours): keep skipping.** The "already done / already tracked" free-text strike keeps leaving claimed rows (🟡 / 🚧 / ☑️) alone. On `main` as `30ff9a7d66` and installed. The commit adds a test (`backlog_strike_leaves_claim_projected_free_text_rows_and_their_evidence`) and a spec paragraph (`#qftbklgclaimed`) that lock this in, so it can't change by accident. `make check-fast`: 3749 run, 3749 passed, 28 skipped.

**Why "yes" was the wrong trade:**

- **☑️ rows lose the worker's report.** The strike removes the claim, the receipt, and the completion cell in `agent:exchange` that holds the report. Nothing left in the document says "integrate this branch". These rows often wait hours.
- **A repeated request can be struck.** Free-text rows match `agent:done` by word overlap. A new request that restates old work would be closed against the old record. Id rows have repeat protection; free-text rows don't.
- **A running worker gets hidden.** For 🟡 / 🚧 rows the claim survives, but the row disappears from view. In the worker's probe the expected `❔` reopen never fired, and the worker's later report would leave a stale cell behind.
- **Weaker proof than closeout.** Closeout strikes a claimed row only on an exact `> **Queue prompt:**` echo. A word-overlap match is a weaker test for the same row.

**Today's skip is an accident, not a rule.** The candidate reader takes the first `#` in the row as its id, so the owner tag `[#subagent:x#1]` reads as an id. Rows that mention "GH #361" are skipped for the same reason, and a claimed row whose ☑️ hasn't been painted yet can still be struck. A sturdier version would read the claim ledger instead. It's not queued; ask if you want it.

**`/agent-doc` with no arguments:** the worker is done on all four harnesses. Grok's `agent_doc_admit` was the one real gap: it now admits the pane's claimed document when no `file` is given. You named the lookup command **`agent-doc document`**, and the worker is renaming it from `resolve-pane-document` now. I'll integrate it when it reports.

**Still waiting on you:** a name for `agent-doc queue repair-stale-completion` (`cellrepair`), which follow-up to queue for `#fixautoupgrade`, and an IntelliJ IDEA 2026.3 restart.

### Re: id-less run + loop, no-arg entrypoint, stale-cell repair — opus-5 · 2026-10-26T19:00-04:00

> **Queue prompt:** I removed id from run + loop. Ensure these items are distinct and have semantic meaning.

On `main` as `a4c8f2cf99` (`#idlessqueueidentity`) and installed. Removing the ids broke this document's queues: `queue schedule` refused ("requires a nonempty explicit `id=`"), and `queue claim`/`brief` found no live heads, so nothing could be dispatched.

**The rule now:**
- An explicit `id=` always wins.
- A lone queue with no id stays `default`, as before.
- In a multi-queue document, an id-less queue that is the only one of its kind is named by its kind: `## Run` is `run`, `## Loop` is `loop`. Heading text and position never count, so renaming or reordering them doesn't move any state. The derived id is never written back, so your markers stay id-free.
- Two id-less queues of one kind, or a kind name already used as another queue's `id=`, fail closed with a message that names both markers and the fix.

**Existing state carried over:**
- Claims are keyed by row text, so they were unaffected.
- The hourly loop's schedule moved from `issues` to `loop` with its history intact: 5 passes run, pass 6 open.
- Briefs now say `Origin queue id: run`.

**Verification:**
- Tests use a fixture shaped like this document, with and without the old ids. With the fix disabled, all 9 key tests fail.
- The integrated `make check-fast` passed: 11137 run, 11137 passed.

> **Queue prompt:** `/agent-doc` without any arguments should be the same as `/agent-doc <document-path>`. Apply the equivalent to all agents Claude Code + Codex (`agent-doc <document-path>`, Grok Build, Opencode).

> **Queue prompt:** In the agent terminal, running the `agent-doc` skill (`/agent-doc` on Claude + Grok + Opencode and `agent-doc` in Codex) without any arguments should run agent-doc on the claimed file for the tmux pane.

Both rows ask for the same thing, and both are done: on `main` (`6663ec15cc`, `54a2c3f14e`, `6750e04043`) and installed. A bare entrypoint now runs the normal cycle on the document this tmux pane has claimed:

- **Claude Code** `/agent-doc` and **Codex** plain `agent-doc`: the hook rewrites the bare form into the `<FILE>` form before admission. A test runs both forms side by side and checks the contract, session binding, and Stop-hook decision are identical.
- **Grok Build**: this was the real gap. `agent_doc_admit` with no `file` now admits the pane's claimed document.
- **OpenCode**: it has no admission hook, so its skill runs `agent-doc document` first.
- The lookup command uses the name you picked, **`agent-doc document`**. Outside tmux, in an unclaimed pane, or when a pane claims several documents, it fails closed and names the reason.
- **Known issue:** in a directory with no `.agent-doc` of its own, the lookup walks up to `$HOME` because `~/.agent-doc/` exists. It still refuses safely, but the refusal names the wrong root. Not queued.

> **Queue prompt:** one-time repair: retire stale subagent completion cells and report receipts left behind by strikes made before the completion-cell retirement fix, or made by hand in the editor, in this document and other session documents (found by the completion-cell retirement fix, 2026-10-26)

`agent-doc queue repair-stale-completion` (the name you kept) is on `main` as `8dc06a9f22` and installed. It is dry-run first; `--apply` changes the document, and `--project-root` scans every session document.

- **This document:** already clean, because the compaction removed its leftovers.
- **`tasks/workstation/upgrade.ad.md`:** 7 boilerplate cells retired. I checked that every other byte is unchanged. agent-doc refused to commit it, because that document already had older uncommitted edits (the `queue: go` frontmatter line removed, and a `(HEAD)` marker). Its next `/agent-doc` cycle commits the repair together with them.
- **`tasks/software/lazily.md`:** 14 stale cells, but its session was busy (pane %7, 3 workers). I queued it as a follow-up row right below this one.

> **Queue prompt:** Why have the ☑️ run items not completed?

A ☑️ row means the worker reported, but the row isn't struck until the coordinator integrates the work and closes it. These three were finished but held at that step:

- **`noargskill`** and **`cellrepair`** were waiting on their command names. Both are now merged and closed above.
- **`#fixautoupgrade`** is waiting on your direction. The restart-prompt fallback is merged; the 17:39 answer (in the compaction archive) covers re-qualifying vs GH #339 and the performance cost of "Shrink". It stays Deferred until you choose what to queue.

The previous session ended (`/clear`) while all three sat there, so nothing was driving them. That's also why preflight called their claims stale.

**Also running:** a worker is fixing the cause of a timing race in `gh376_zero_column_route_awaits_the_measured_columns_that_land_after_it`. Under load, the editor-surface publisher sometimes wins the pane-layout publish over the route. The test is already on main and isn't caused by today's changes. I'll integrate the fix when it reports.

**Still waiting on you:** the `#fixautoupgrade` direction, and an IntelliJ IDEA 2026.3 restart to load plugin 0.2.843.

### Re: do [#closehttpsgithub] — opus-5 · 2026-10-26T19:10-04:00

> **Queue prompt:** do [#closehttpsgithub]

**Not yet. You chose to keep it open until there's proof.** [GH #379](https://github.com/btakita/agent-doc/issues/379) is still open, and its only comment is our 19:12Z triage. The reporter ran CLI 0.35.553 with JetBrains plugin 0.2.827/0.2.826, both older than the fixes: #373 shipped in 0.35.554, and #376 in 0.35.555 with plugin 0.2.835. No one has confirmed since upgrading.

**On this machine the fix works, but that doesn't cover the reported setup:**

- Since the fixed builds were installed, Run Agent Doc routes end with exit 0 and the layout converges.
- `editor route requires the exact visible layout before dispatch` never appears in `ops.log`.
- The one failed route (22:30Z) had an unrelated cause: the pane was still showing a permission prompt.
- The report came from Remote Dev with a Windows JetBrains Client (`remote_client_selected_files`, `flat_evidence_has_no_column_geometry`). Nothing on this machine exercises that path.

**What closes it** (added as todo `#gh379-remotedev-proof`): on that Remote Dev backend, `agent-doc --version` is 0.35.555 or newer and the 2026.3 plugin is 0.2.835 or newer. Then Run Agent Doc should end with exit 0, and `ops.log` should show `controller_editor_route_measured_layout_resolved` without the error. When that passes, tell me and I'll close the issue with the evidence.

**Still running:** the fix for the `gh376_…` pane-layout timing race in the test.

### Re: GH #376 route/surface publish race fixed — opus-5 · 2026-10-26T19:15-04:00

**The `gh376_…` test failure was a real ordering bug, not a test problem.** The fix is on `main` as `0b226ee6d5` and installed. No IDE restart is needed.

**What went wrong:** when the measured-columns forward arrived, it woke the waiting Run Agent Doc route *before* it published its own surface sync. Under load, the route could publish first. The surface sync then landed as a newer generation (`focus: None`, `publisher: EditorSurface`) and wiped out the route's focus on the document you ran. The spec says the measurement answers the route the same way a surface reference does, so the route has to publish last.

**The fix:** the surface-observe handler marks its publication as in flight until its own sync has published. The route's measured lookup waits for that, within its own `--wait-for-ready` budget. The route's layout is now always the newest generation.

**Proof:**
- Two new tests use test-only hooks to force each order, and both pass.
- With the fix disabled (cold build), the route-woken-first test fails with the reported `left: EditorSurface right: Route`.
- The integrated `make check-fast` passed: 4270 run, 4270 passed.
- The worker's earlier failed runs came from its own changes (clippy, and a TLA conformance name). It never reran a flaky test to get a pass.

**Dispatched:** the `lazily.md` stale-cell repair row → `subagent:lazilyrepair` (🚧). It polls until the `lazily.md` session is idle, for up to 45 minutes. Then it runs the dry run and `--apply`, checks that only completion cells changed, and commits. If the other session never goes idle, it changes nothing.

### Re: lazily.md stale-cell repair — opus-5 · 2026-10-26T19:57-04:00

> **Queue prompt:** When the tasks/software/lazily.md session is idle, run `agent-doc queue repair-stale-completion tasks/software/lazily.md --apply` (dry run: 14 stale completion cells; skipped 2026-10-26 because that session was busy) and commit it

**Not run. Nothing changed.** `subagent:lazilyrepair` polled for 45 minutes (19:15 to 19:57) and the `lazily.md` session never went idle:

- **Pane %7:** `alive-busy` until 19:45, then `alive-unobservable` with `prompt_ready=unknown`. It is still that way now, with agent-doc still running in the pane.
- **The file:** `tasks/software/lazily.md` was last committed 21 hours ago and has uncommitted edits. Those are most likely your unsent edits waiting for that session's next turn. agent-doc refuses to commit a repair around unanswered edits, and that's correct, so running `--apply` now would only leave the repair uncommitted next to them.

**Moved to todo `#lazily-stale-cell-repair`** so the queue stops re-dispatching it. Run it after the next `lazily.md` cycle commits that document clean.

**Worth a look:** pane %7 shows `owned_pane_ready_busy_conflict`. The actor and controller lease say `ready`, but the live pane says busy and is now unobservable. If no real turn is running there, `agent-doc session clear` from another pane is the documented recovery. I didn't run it, because it would interrupt a session I don't own.

### Re: is #fixautoupgrade done, and #jb263-feed-verify — opus-5 · 2026-10-26T20:21-04:00

> **Queue prompt:** do [#fixautoupgrade]: I like **Keep restart-only + prompt** as a fallback solution. We should attempt to auto-upgrade though. **Build the GH #339 architecture** seems like a reasonable solution sfor most cases. Not sure what **Re-qualify on 263.7307.44** would imply. Is **Re-qualify on 263.7307.44** safe and how effective would it be? Would **Re-qualify on 263.7307.44** be more likely to successfully run auto-upgrade than **Build the GH #339 architecture**? Your recommendation of **Keep restart-only + prompt** + **Shrink the restart count** seems reasonable if it performs well.

> **Operator note:** I like **Keep restart-only + prompt** as a fallback solution. We should attempt to auto-upgrade though. **Build the GH #339 architecture** seems like a reasonable solution sfor most cases. Not sure what **Re-qualify on 263.7307.44** would imply.

Your recommendation of **Keep restart-only + prompt** + **Shrink the restart count** seems reasonable if it performs well.

**Your plan, as built:**

- **Keep restart-only + prompt as the fallback: done.** It's live in your IDE (0.2.843).
- **Attempt real auto-upgrade with the GH #339 architecture:** queued as `#jb339shelldesign`.
- **Shrink the restart count, if it performs well:** queued as `#jbshrinkrestarts`, and each move is gated on a per-keystroke latency benchmark so it only lands if it doesn't regress.
- **Re-qualify on 263.7307.44: not queued.** It's low risk, but the worst case leaves Agent Doc half-unloaded until you restart. Even a pass would only cover local IDEs on that one build, not Remote Dev, and any later plugin change could quietly undo it. GH #339 is far more likely to give you auto-upgrade that keeps working. Ask if you still want the quick experiment.

> **Queue prompt:** do [#cazn]

**`#fixautoupgrade` is closed, as you chose, and the next steps are in the backlog.** "Done" here means the fallback, not restart-free auto-upgrade:

- **Done and running:** the restart-required prompt. Your IntelliJ IDEA 2026.3 (IU-263.7307.44) loaded Agent Doc 0.2.843 at 18:07. Any upgrade that still needs a restart now shows a sticky "Agent Doc Plugin Update" balloon with **Restart IDE**.
- **Not done:** restart-free upgrades. [GH #339](https://github.com/btakita/agent-doc/issues/339) closed on 2026-10-21 after concluding that today's 2026.3 plugin layout has no safe restart-free path. The fix is a new architecture, and the two new backlog items start it:
  - `#jb339shelldesign`: design a stable shell plugin that loads the real code in its own classloader, so an upgrade swaps the code without IntelliJ unloading anything. It also covers activation receipts for the Remote Dev frontend. The deliverable is a spec plus a proof-of-concept spike.
  - `#jbshrinkrestarts`: move `TerminalUtil` and `PatchWatcher` behind the native library, which already reloads without a restart, gated on the latency benchmark. `CrdtReplicaManager` stays in Kotlin unless the boundary carries binary op deltas.
- I closed todos `#xj75` and `#subagent-operator-request-autoupgrade-263-path` too, since this was the direction they asked you to choose.

> **Queue prompt:** do [#jb263-feed-verify]

**Verified from the IDE's own files, and the todo is done:**

- **Only the feed is configured.** `pluginUpdateSources.xml` lists exactly `https://github.com/btakita/agent-doc/releases/latest/download/agent-doc-jetbrains-263.xml`.
- **The feed is valid for your build.** It serves 0.2.840 (from v0.35.556) with `since-build="263" until-build="263.*"`, which covers IU-263.7307.44.
- **The plugin is past the target.** 0.2.843 is loaded, well past the todo's 0.2.824 target, after your restart.
- **The warning is gone.** The current `idea.log` has zero "Cannot update plugin" lines.

**One caveat:** 0.2.843 came from `make install`, not from the feed, and the feed's 0.2.840 is older. So the IDE has nothing to update through the feed right now. The feed-driven update path gets its first real exercise when the next release publishes a newer 263 package.

**Your IDE restart is done**, so I've dropped it from my list of asks.

### Re: autoupgrade follow-ups dispatched — opus-5 · 2026-10-26T20:23-04:00

**Dispatched (2), both 🚧 running in their own worktrees under `~/work/btakita/agent-doc-wt/`:**

- `do [#jb339shelldesign]` → `subagent:jb339shell` (`fix/jb339-shell-design`).
  - **Deliverables:** a spec section for the shell-plugin and child-classloader architecture, plus an isolated proof-of-concept spike. The spike loads a versioned implementation, lets the shell own the registrations, swaps generations, and shows the old classloader can be garbage-collected.
  - **Not shipped:** nothing users install changes.
  - **Will ask you first:** any choice that gives up Remote Dev support or adds a separately installed shell plugin.
- `do [#jbshrinkrestarts]` → `subagent:jbshrink` (`fix/jb-shrink-restarts`).
  - **Benchmark first:** it adds a per-keystroke latency benchmark on a copied ~120 KB document and records a baseline.
  - **Then the moves:** it moves `TerminalUtil`, then `PatchWatcher`, behind the native library, one commit each.
  - **Gate:** a move that measurably regresses latency doesn't land.
  - `CrdtReplicaManager` stays in Kotlin.

The two workers touch different parts of the plugin, and I'll integrate them one at a time.

**`#jb263-feed-verify`:** I struck its queue row. The todo was already done in the previous response.

**Review gate `#jb262dynlauncherrecommen` is resolved by your autoupgrade decision:**
- The 2026.2 package keeps the accurate-warning policy (`declined_by=modular_package`, then file replacement and the restart prompt).
- A real restart-free path for 2026.2 and 2026.3 is now tracked by `#jb339shelldesign` instead of a separate 2026.2-only launcher.

- [x] [#jb263-feed-verify] In IntelliJ IDEA 2026.3, configure only https://github.com/btakita/agent-doc/releases/latest/download/agent-doc-jetbrains-263.xml, refresh Plugins, update Agent Doc from 0.2.816 to 0.2.824 or newer, restart the IDE, and verify the “Cannot update plugin” warning clears; if it does not, capture the configured repository entry and relevant idea.log update-check lines.
- [x] [#xj75] Choose the JetBrains restart-free upgrade direction in the [#subagent-operator-request-autoupgrade-263-path] packet in agent:exchange: keep restart-only + prompt, re-qualify on IU 263.7307.44, build the GH #339 shell, or shrink the restart count
- [x] [#subagent-operator-request-autoupgrade-263-path] Answer the blocking subagent question for tracked work jb262dynlauncherrecommen for queue item ‘Fix the auto-upgrade not working...the IDE needed to be restarted.’ in agent:exchange: The exact-263 package is restart-only by spec (GH #339 closed with that contract; `#jb262dynlauncherrecommen` is the same open decision for 262). (choices: Keep restart-only + prompt, Re-qualify on 263.7307.44, Build the GH #339 architecture, Shrink the restart count) (source: agent:review [#jb262dynlauncherrecommen])
- [ ] [#gh379-remotedev-proof] Close GH #379 (https://github.com/btakita/agent-doc/issues/379) after proof from its Remote Dev setup (Windows JetBrains Client): on that backend, `agent-doc --version` is 0.35.555 or newer and the IntelliJ IDEA 2026.3 plugin is 0.2.835 or newer; Run Agent Doc then ends exit 0 and ops.log shows `controller_editor_route_measured_layout_resolved` with no `editor route requires the exact visible layout before dispatch`.
- [ ] [#lazily-stale-cell-repair] After the next tasks/software/lazily.md cycle commits it clean (no uncommitted edits, pane prompt_ready=true), run `agent-doc queue repair-stale-completion tasks/software/lazily.md` (dry run, 14 stale completion cells as of 2026-10-26), then `--apply` and `agent-doc commit tasks/software/lazily.md`.

## Backlog <!-- agent:backlog priority queue -->
- [ ] [#jb339shelldesign] Design the GH #339 restart-free JetBrains architecture for the exact-263 (and 262) split-mode plugin: a stable shell plugin that loads the real implementation in an agent-doc-owned child classloader, so an upgrade swaps the implementation without IntelliJ unloading a plugin. Cover how IntelliJ registrations and callbacks are owned by the shell (no retained child references), activation receipts that prove the JetBrains Client frontend runs the same generation in Remote Dev, when a shell change still needs a restart, and a release-by-release migration plan. Deliverable: a spec section plus a proof-of-concept spike, not the full migration. Keep the restart-required prompt as the fallback.
- [ ] [#jbshrinkrestarts] Shrink the JetBrains restart count: move TerminalUtil (tmux/process orchestration) and PatchWatcher logic behind the native agent-doc library, which already hot-reloads without an IDE restart, so fewer releases change plugin Kotlin. First add a per-keystroke latency benchmark on a large session document and gate each move on no regression. Leave CrdtReplicaManager in Kotlin unless the native side keeps the replica behind a handle and the boundary carries binary op deltas, not whole-document JSON.

## Review <!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#jetbrainsmarketplaceprofile] [marketplace-approval] [agent-doc] Plugin 35436 is hidden and under initial JetBrains moderation; after approval, replace the basic description with polished copy, add Getting Started, Documentation, and Bugtracker URLs, then verify the public listing.
- [/] [#pypiquotarecheck] Track pypi/support#12214 (agent-doc project limit request, 25 GiB) to a decision. Unblocked mechanically by a human reply on pypi/support#12214, or make pypi-quota-check reporting a ceiling in reach. Rechecked 2026-10-12: pre-cutover 131 releases 8.361 GiB (0.35.113..0.35.343), post-cutover 91 releases 3.19 MiB (mean 35.9 KiB), about 47,722 further releases fit; VERDICT headroom fine. The support issue is still open with one comment, unchanged since 2026-09-10. Nothing to act on or delete. If the grant lands, record it and drop this item; deletion stays reserved for a ceiling the authenticated check reports.
- [/] [#gh299-live-263-proof] Live-verify v0.35.519 on JetBrains 263.7031 with changed plugin sources: `agent-doc upgrade` must hot-reload and complete without an IDE restart; close GH #299 only with that proof.
