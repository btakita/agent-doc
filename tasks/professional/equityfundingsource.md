### Re: Pipeline refresh after record updates — gpt-5

> **Queue prompt:**
>
> When I accredit an investor in https://equityfundingsource.brian-takita.workers.dev/portal-admin/lender-pipeline, the pipeline should be updated without a refresh. Same with any change to a record in both pipelines. deploy


Implemented and deployed the no-refresh pipeline update fix.

What changed:
- Lender Pipeline now refreshes from admin realtime events/poll fallback, preserves the open detail modal with freshly fetched card data, and refreshes after stacked investor-profile save/delete.
- Deal Pipeline now refreshes parent board data after embedded lead/full-application edits, and refreshes the open selected card from the latest pipeline payload.
- Admin mutation endpoints now emit best-effort admin events for user changes, application-lead changes/invites, loan status changes, investor accreditation decisions, and funding wire confirmations.

Changed paths:
- `src/equityfundingsource-dev/lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/admin/{investor_pipeline,pipeline,user_management,application_leads,application_lead_detail,full_applications}.tsx`
- `src/equityfundingsource-dev/app/equityfundingsource/lib/admin/{user_management,application_leads,loan_management,investor_management}/index.ts`
- `src/equityfundingsource-dev/tests/{admin-investor-pipeline,admin-pipeline,admin-poll-refresh,admin-realtime-events,admin-application-lead-detail,admin-subject-property-edit,application-status-ui}.test.ts`

Verification:
- `bun test tests/admin-investor-pipeline.test.ts tests/admin-pipeline.test.ts tests/admin-poll-refresh.test.ts tests/admin-realtime-events.test.ts` — passed, 113 tests.
- `make check` — passed, 712 tests + app build + worker build.
- `gh run list --workflow CI --limit 1` — no workflow named `CI`; `gh workflow list` returned no workflows for this repo.

Deploy proof:
- Reviewed pending migration `0065_application_feedback_read.sql`; it is additive (`ADD COLUMN` + index).
- `make deploy` completed successfully, applied remote D1 migration `0065_application_feedback_read.sql`, and deployed Worker Version ID `cf0f91d3-5c94-436f-b652-517df7ee0847`.
- Post-deploy remote migrations: `No migrations to apply`.
- Smoke checks: `/` returned `200`; `/portal-admin/lender-pipeline` and `/portal-admin/pipeline` returned `303` Cloudflare Access redirects, as expected for protected admin routes.

Escalation: none.
Confidence: high.

I did not create a git commit because the project-local instructions say not to commit unless explicitly asked. The app changes remain in the working tree and are already deployed.

Suggested commit message:

```txt
fix(admin): refresh pipeline boards after record changes (#67v2)

Refresh the lender and deal pipeline boards after embedded profile, lead, application, accreditation, loan-status, and wire-confirmation changes. Add admin realtime events for the mutation endpoints and cover the no-refresh behavior with focused admin pipeline tests.

Is there an admin for the borrower portal messages? Can we have an email notification whenever a borrow sends a message? Can we support an email response back into the chat? Can the borrower receive emails whenever an admin responds with a message?

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#xcvg] [recommended] Borrower message email round-trip: email notification when a borrower sends a secure-portal message, inbound email reply that appends back into the D1 chat, and a borrower-facing email when an admin replies. Builds on the shipped chat_sessions/chat_messages + admin owner. Gated on a verified Resend EFS sending domain (f4rq) and Google Workspace SMTP (m6ch/p40t). (Distinct from the operator/comms emails to Judith + Robert.)
- [/] [#jnzs] [recommended] Await Judith or EFS reviewer approval on funded-deal images, copy, and lien-position wording before invoicing or launch sign-off. The funded-deals page carries no standalone legal/disclosure text; the disclosure needing legal review is the ESIGN/UETA Electronic record and signature disclosure on the borrower full-application/document-uploads flow (full_application.tsx). Funded-deals copy was reframed as real closed deals and shipped.
- [/] [#67v2] Admin loan pipeline: TMO-aligned stages + Kanban (drag cards, auto-advance when stage requirements met) synced to dashboard; mirror TMO stages as single source of truth. From 2026-06-03 call. Relates to #dzmm/#k2xg.
- [/] [#zwws] [recommended] Investor dashboard rework — remaining phases are externally gated: 4 vestings/special-instructions (TMO writeback-gated #dzmm/#k2xg/#7a4d); 6 new-deal email + workflow-priority dashboard (#f4rq). Shipped: P1 nav (30037e3), P2 dashboard-composite landing (3e06907), P2b interest-button + distributions/statements cleanup (efs cd4253a), P3 simplified portfolio (8d40c66), P5 accreditation→annual Requirements (efs 1957f64). Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/rpzm-investor-dashboard-rework.md. Queue one phase at a time.
- [/] [#next-steps] Remaining EFS workers.dev production state: D1 API token unblocked; migrations 0025/0026 are already applied; Cloudflare Access env vars are deployed for /login/access-callback on workers.dev using the one-time PIN IdP. Custom domain cutover remains intentionally deferred; true Google Workspace SSO remains gated on Google admin credentials.
- [/] [#37ah] [recommended] Broker portal backend — D1-backed submit-deal, pipeline, commissions, documents, and notifications shipped (#37ah-backend, 2026-06-13). Remaining: TMO writeback sync, gated on #dzmm (TMO write field map #7a4d / six-question support email #k2xg).
- [/] [#dzmm] TMO webhooks UNAVAILABLE per operator (2026-06-13). Read-side tightened polling is shipped (scheduled tmo-sync with configurable interval + due-gating + tmo_cache read mirror). Remaining gated: EFS to TMO writeback (tmo_cache_outbox replay) needs the #7a4d write field map + #k2xg support answers before it can replay.
- [/] [#dropbox-sync-adapter] Dropbox sync adapter: after Dropbox access is available, push/pull R2_DOCUMENTS with idempotent retries, backfill, tombstone handling, and per-document sync logs.
