### Re: #lzjshygiene — generic conformance fixture assertion validation (lazily-js) — opus-4-8

> **Queue prompt:**

> [#lzjshygiene]


Drained the queue head `#lzjshygiene`. The work was already implemented locally (uncommitted in `src/lazily-js/test/ipc.test.js`); I verified, completed parity, and shipped it.

**What it does** — `assertFixtureAssertions(message, fixture)` cross-checks **every** `assertions` metadata field on each conformance fixture against the parsed snapshot/delta message, so the `wire` block and the `assertions` block can no longer drift silently. This is the JS parity of lazily-kt `#lzktconf`:
- Snapshot keys: `epoch`, `node_count`, `edge_count`, `root_count`, `first_node_type_tag`, `first_node_state_kind`, `has_opaque_node`, `opaque_node_id`, `blob_{offset,len,epoch}`.
- Delta keys: `base_epoch`, `epoch`, `is_sequential`, `op_count`, `has_all_op_variants`, `resync_after_epoch_10`, `first_op_kind`, `first_op_payload_kind`.
- **Unknown assertion keys throw** — new fixture metadata can never be silently ignored.
- Wired into the `all fixtures round trip` loop + a dedicated drift-detection test (mutated `node_count` and an unknown key both fail loudly).

**Verification** — `npm run build` (node --check) green; `npm test` green at **28 pass** (was 27; +1 drift test). Parity confirmed with lazily-kt: both cover the same 6 IPC JSON fixtures. `arena_blob.json` (LZSH arena format, not IPC JSON wire) is intentionally excluded in both ports.

**Shipped** — lazily-js `6d38122` (pushed to `lazily-hub/lazily-js`), superproject gitlink bumped + pushed. Preset `#spec-test-build-install-commit-push`: no spec change needed (assertions already live in the fixtures); no install step for a pure-JS workspace package.

**Observations (not blocking):** `package-lock.json` is untracked but not git-ignored in lazily-js — a real but separate gap from this task; left uncommitted to keep this commit scoped. A `stale_install` warning fired on agent-doc itself (built binary predates source commit `59c2f74f`) — that's an agent-doc dev concern, out of scope for this lazily session.

- [/] [#lilazilysmpost] [/] [operator-drive] lazily state-machine LinkedIn post PUBLISHED WITH IMAGE: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7475622100263923712 (mail/social/20260624-142530-linkedin.md @ mail bf4ab26). CyclePhase diagram rendered from blog post SVG (light theme colors) + uploaded via LinkedIn digitalmediaAsset API. Old text-only post (urn:li:share:7475617202893639680) deleted + replaced. Remaining operator follow-up: post first comment (link + GitHub source) via corky linkedin comment.
- [/] [#kb9b] #lzpypub011=[operator-drive] Publish lazily-py v0.11.0: SHIP-STOPPER #lzpysigfix is FIXED (commit 30907ea). Build artifacts rebuilt in src/lazily-py/dist/ (lazily-0.11.0-{whl,tar.gz}, twine check PASSED, fresh-venv install round-trip verified). From src/lazily-py: tag v0.11.0 + push, gh release create v0.11.0 --generate-notes, then python -m twine upload dist/* (needs PyPI token + browser/passkey 2FA). Gated on the pre-publish live-test confirm per the testing-gate rule. Commit 30907ea + superproject gitlink eb93a75ac already pushed.
- [/] [#kabc] #lipostlazilyarch=[operator-drive] Main LinkedIn post is published and repaired: Corky edit updated mail/social/20260616-lazily-architecture-linkedin.md / https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7472666756810190848 with the full body after the public post truncated at "The core is small: three primitives". Local metadata is committed in mail commit 07a9ea1 and superproject gitlink e7e0b08c1. Remaining operator follow-up: post the first comment from mail/drafts/linkedin/2026-06-16-lazily-architecture.md via `corky linkedin comment <published-file> <comment-body>` if still desired.
- [/] [#h6qb] [recommended] [operator-drive] #lzwebrtcnet-e2e=End-to-end cross-host validation of the Str0mNet backend through the LIVE #yxjw signaling Worker (two real hosts / NAT). Agent-doable slice (#lzwebrtcwire) is DONE: src/webrtc_signaling.rs wires SignalingClient↔Str0mNet and tests/webrtc_signaling.rs covers the localhost handshake. Remaining: live two-host/NAT run via deployed Worker — operator-only.
- [/] [#xccx] #lzholons=[operator-drive] Map Holons ↔ lazily-rs integration. Phase 0 (discovery) is blocked on Steve Melville answering the 7 OPEN QUESTIONS (holon identity, holon↔node/edge mapping, change feed, write/conflict model, permissions mapping, preferred transport, spec reference). Plan: tasks/software/plan-map-holons-integration.md. Unblocks once answers land; then Phase 1 read-only inbound adapter.

## Icebox

<!-- agent:icebox -->
- [ ] [#lzsidecarlock] [recommended] agent-doc-repo: close the lost-update window among concurrent cycle_state writers. Deadlock analysis DONE (tasks/agent-doc/plan-cycle-state-flock.md): NO production mutator calls another (only test code) -> non-reentrant flock is safe. Design: bounded try_lock_exclusive (~5s, fs2) + RAII guard on a dedicated .json.lock sibling (state file is atomically renamed each save -> cannot lock it directly); add `let _lock = acquire_state_lock(file)?;` to each of the ~24 public mutators in cycle_state.rs. cycle_phase_rank (:1273) guards only monotonic phase, not the ~30 non-phase fields. Hardening (not live-fire). Split from #lzsidecaratomic (DONE in agent-doc 647af082 + installed).
- [ ] [#pw26] #lzmapspike=[recommended] Spike: lazily-rs as a host-side reactive derivation + Snapshot/Delta UI-sync cache for MAP holons (evomimic/map-holons, Holochain). Model committed holons as reactive graph nodes; derived holon views/relationships as memoized computeds that recompute only on upstream change; stream lazily-ipc Snapshot/Delta to the TS UI / DAHN graph visualizers. Native host/ layer only (AsyncContext needs tokio; zomes are wasm32/short-lived/single-threaded so in-zome use is limited to single-threaded Context). Do NOT use lazily distributed/signaling — Holochain DHT owns P2P/persistence/validation/consensus. Gate on MAP host-layer actually recomputing derived holon state.
