### Re: Application Next-Step Alert And Deploy — gpt-5

> **Queue prompt:**
> In https://equityfundingsource.brian-takita.workers.dev/admin/pipeline?dialog=application&dialog_application_id=6046c03f-2f7d-462b-8b89-d116effc93b6, add an alert with explaining the next actionable step to advance the application with a CTA button.
> deploy

Done. The admin Pipeline application dialog now shows a status-aware next-step alert before the detail rows. The CTA opens the existing stacked Full Application dialog, with copy that either tells the admin to complete required core data and mark the application Complete, or to review/decide on a submitted/in-review application.

Changed paths: `src/equityfundingsource-dev` at `ba39c67`; parent submodule pointer at `ee4a32358`. Key files were `lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/admin/pipeline.tsx`, `lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/admin/full_applications.tsx`, `lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/shared/full_application_detail.tsx`, `app/equityfundingsource/lib/admin/applications/index.ts`, and related Bun tests.

Commits/push/deploy: EFS commit `ba39c67 feat(admin): surface application advancement CTA (#pipeline-full-app-dialog)` was pushed to `origin/main`; parent pointer commit `ee4a32358 chore(efs): bump application advancement submodule` was pushed to `origin/main`; deployed Worker version `891e4b29-bb5c-49c3-ba8e-5a0b28ed6c04`.

Verification: focused Bun tests passed with `94 pass / 0 fail`; `make check` passed with `1186 pass / 0 fail`, app build, and worker build. The digest wrapper flagged the intentional logged `d1 down` fixture from the non-fatal outbox test, but the raw Bun logs report zero failures. D1 preflight/post-deploy checks showed no migrations to apply, D1 info returned, and Time Travel bookmark `00000509-00000000-00005094-f7cc40fb5e53febfca67cef7da291ced` was available. Smoke checks: public `/` returned `200`; the admin deep link returned `303`, consistent with Cloudflare Access redirect.

CI/workflows: `gh run list --workflow CI --limit 1` found no `CI` workflow in either EFS or the parent repo. `gh workflow list` returned no EFS workflows and only `Agent Doc` in the parent repo.

Escalation: none. Confidence: high for the shipped code/deploy path; the final live visual check of the admin-only dialog still requires an authenticated browser session.

### Re: Deploy — gpt-5

> **Queue prompt:**
> deploy

Done. I redeployed the current EFS Worker through the project deployment path (`make deploy`), which rebuilt the Worker, checked/applied remote D1 migrations, and activated Cloudflare Worker version `35ce9176-4565-4aaa-b064-03bd63065324` at `https://equityfundingsource.brian-takita.workers.dev`.

Changed paths: none in `src/equityfundingsource-dev`; the submodule is clean on `main` at `ba39c67` / `origin/main`. The parent repo still has unrelated dirty files, but I did not touch them.

Verification: `make check` passed with `1186 pass / 0 fail`, app build, and Worker build. Pre-deploy and post-deploy D1 checks both reported no migrations to apply. D1 info returned successfully for database `280e1539-b940-4c59-8988-fbed63c12ac0`, and Time Travel reported current bookmark `00000509-00000010-00005094-54e662098a450514cb2e36b3dd1b69a7`. Post-deploy smoke checks returned `200` for `/` and `303` for the admin pipeline deep link, consistent with Cloudflare Access redirect on admin routes.

CI/workflows: `gh run list --workflow CI --limit 1` found no workflow named `CI` in either the EFS submodule or the parent repo.

Escalation: none. Confidence: high for deploy/build/D1/smoke coverage; authenticated visual verification of the admin-only dialog still requires an authenticated browser session.

### Re: Accept Application Guidance And Deploy — gpt-5

> **Queue prompt:**
> In https://equityfundingsource.brian-takita.workers.dev/admin/pipeline?dialog=application&dialog_application_id=6046c03f-2f7d-462b-8b89-d116effc93b6, add guidance on what needs to be completed before being able to Accept Application.
> deploy

Done. The Deal Pipeline application dialog now fetches the selected full-application detail, runs the same shared approval blocker gate used by the Accept action, and shows a `Before Accept Application` checklist in the existing next-step alert. The checklist shows exact missing items, a loading/error state, or a ready message when submission, core data, declarations, and e-signature are complete.

Changed paths: `src/equityfundingsource-dev` at `295ca29`; parent submodule pointer at `a5bdda62b`. Key files were `lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/admin/pipeline.tsx`, `tests/admin-pipeline.test.ts`, and `prds/67v2-admin-loan-pipeline-kanban.md`. Unrelated dirty files in the parent repo were left untouched.

Commits/push/deploy: EFS commit `295ca29 feat(admin): show application accept blockers (#pipeline-full-app-dialog)` was pushed to `origin/main`; parent pointer commit `a5bdda62b chore(efs): bump application guidance submodule` was pushed to `origin/main`; deployed Worker version `16958120-9119-48d8-8352-7354c99a9358` at `https://equityfundingsource.brian-takita.workers.dev`.

Verification: focused tests passed (`bun test tests/admin-pipeline.test.ts tests/admin-full-application-approve-ui.test.ts`: `72 pass / 0 fail`). Full local verification passed (`make check`: `1186 pass / 0 fail`, app build, and Worker build). Pre-deploy D1 checks reported no pending migrations, D1 info returned for database `280e1539-b940-4c59-8988-fbed63c12ac0`, and Time Travel bookmark `00000509-00000010-00005094-54e662098a450514cb2e36b3dd1b69a7` was available. Deploy ran through `make deploy`; post-deploy migrations still report none pending. Smoke checks returned `200` for `/` and `303` for the admin pipeline deep link, consistent with Cloudflare Access on admin routes.

CI/workflows: `gh run list --workflow CI --limit 1` found no workflow named `CI` in either the EFS submodule or the parent repo.

Escalation: none. Confidence: high for code, tests, push, D1/deploy, and unauthenticated smoke coverage; final visual verification of the admin-only dialog still requires an authenticated browser session.

## Backlog

<!-- agent:backlog priority queue -->
- [/] [#vcyr] Send rwaldman100+admin@gmail.com admin login link to btak.dev+admin@gmail.com once a working Cloudflare Email Sending API token is available or Brian explicitly confirms an alternate sender/body. Verified Robert is active admin; current local Cloudflare/Resend credentials cannot send; no active unused Robert login tokens remain.
<!-- /agent:backlog -->

## Review

<!-- agent:review -->
- [/] [#04v8] [recommended] Validate TMO cross-service lender visibility in a real TMO sandbox/tenant before relying on automated LOS funding writes: create or link a lender through `LSS.svc`, confirm `GetLender`, then attempt `LOS.svc` `AddLoanFunding`/`UpdateLoanFunding` on a test loan or get written TMO support confirmation that LOS funding resolves the LSS lender/vendor master `Account`.
- [/] [#apply-invite-fail-ux] Public `/apply` invite-failure UX: when the borrower invite email fails or is skipped after lead persistence, stop telling the borrower to check their inbox; show a received/follow-up message, keep the failed invite status visible to admins, and add a regression test.
- [/] [#email-bg-outbox] Durable email delivery observability/retry: record lifecycle, secure-message, broker, lending-group, investor-interest, login-link, invite, reminder, and feedback email results in D1 with status/error/retry/dead-letter instead of relying on console-only warnings for background notifications.
- [/] [#email-prod-ready] Email production-readiness hardening: provision a dedicated `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL_API_TOKEN` secret with Email Sending scope, verify `BROKER_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED` if broker email is expected, add an admin/CI diagnostic that fails when production delivery would fall back to local capture, and document that `MESSAGE_EMAIL_INBOUND_SECRET` is only needed for the HTTP parsed-inbound route.
- [/] [#mcme] [recommended] #msg-read-status Email-open-based read receipts — DEFERRED: Cloudflare Email Sending has no open-tracking webhook, and transactional mail should stay on Cloudflare Email Sending. If email-open receipts become mandatory, design a Cloudflare-compatible tracking-pixel/event subsystem or accept portal-only read cursors. In-app portal read cursors already exist for borrower chat (`chat_sessions.*_last_read_at`) but are not email reads.
- [/] [#msg-unify4] [gated: awaiting dual-write prod soak] Lender cutover — dual-write (best-effort mirror into messages, both lender sources) + backfill (migration 0098) SHIPPED (EFS b5a6a55). Remaining: after soak, switch the inbox to read lender data from messages (dual-read), then drop deal_interest_lender_messages + lender_account_messages. Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/message-unification.md.
- [/] [#msg-unify3] [gated: awaiting dual-write prod soak] Borrower cutover — dual-write (best-effort mirror into messages) + backfill (migration 0097) SHIPPED (EFS 411a4da). Remaining: after the dual-write soaks live, switch the unified inbox to read borrower data from messages (dual-read), then drop chat_messages. Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/message-unification.md.
- [/] [#lender-card-msg-email] [recommended] Email-to-lender parity for #lender-card-msg account messages (mirror notify_lender_deal_message_): notify the lender by email when an admin posts an account message, like the deal-interest thread does. Rides the Cloudflare Email Sending / verified EFS sender gate (#f4rq). Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/lender-card-messaging.md.
- [/] [#proprate] Lender proposal persists a DEFAULT interest rate never finalized. investor/deal_detail.tsx:362 pre-fills proposal_rate from deal.monthly_interest when deal.proposal_interest_rate==null; submit (:425-435) sends it whenever an amount is present; :421 requires a finite rate, so a lender cannot commit an amount with rate TBD — the pre-filled default (6.5% on d6b78994) persists as if finalized. Duration NOT affected (no proposal_term_months column). DATA CLEANUP DONE 2026-06-20: nulled proposal_interest_rate on the d6b78994/b8ccaa76 row (kept proposal_amount=100000 + proposal_submitted_at; D1 changes=1). CODE FIX still pending operator go: do NOT pre-fill the rate with the deal default; allow proposal_interest_rate=null ("amount committed, rate TBD"); relax :421 validation + admin LoanTermProposalSummary display.
- [/] [#nthc] [operator-verify] DEPLOYED 2026-06-20 (worker version 17b06176-fc91-44b6-b35d-1cd61beed01b; EFS 8889a4c). Remaining = operator live-verify only: open the Lender Bros group Edit overlay on deal d6b78994, bump lender2 from 0%, confirm the split saves and the "60% confirmed (partial)" badge reconciles.
- [/] [#pmhf] [recommended] Reuse the rebalancing share editor (lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/shared/lending_groups_alloc.ts: rebalance_stakes_/distribute_evenly_/lock pins) in the per-deal split UI (deal_detail allocations) so per-deal % editing gets the same 100%-balanced, lockable inputs.
- [/] [#dealtab500] [operator-verify] Root-cause the deal 7a0c1463 / loan 45ddae53 (GQI751) loan-tab "Internal Error". Static trace independently re-confirmed exhausted: GET /admin/pipeline serves only a shell (no server-side deal processing); every client-fetched endpoint is guarded — admin_loan_R_ is a plain SELECT, admin_deal_R_ LTV/onboarding chain (onboarding_json_/loan_ltv_calc_) is fully try/catch + null guarded, /documents is harmless; all client fetches degrade to error cards, not the worker Internal Error page. Regression guard shipped (efs a39be3d) locking the thin-TMO-loan onboarding shape against throws (gformula deal-economics helpers). REMAINING (operator-gated, cannot be agent-done): reproduce live via `bun run cf:worker:tail` + a browser click on the loan tab to capture the real throwing endpoint + stack, OR inspect loan 45ddae53/deal 7a0c1463 D1 rows once the #cftk token lands. Relates to #5q7z/#214f.
- [/] [#5q7z] [recommended] 'Accept and send to TMO' duplicate-loan bug: for a loan already associated with a TMO record (deal 7a0c1463 / loan 45ddae53 has tmo_loan_number=GQI751, tmo_loan_rec_id=3840D27B..., tmo_loan_application_rec_id=cda67748), the approve flow (admin/applications/index.ts application_tmo_writeback_attempt_ -> tmo_writeback.ts:308 LOS.svc/NewLoan) sends NewLoan with the existing GQI751 -> TMO 400 'Duplicate loan number. Unable to save record.' Fix (2 parts): (1) approve/writeback must detect an existing TMO association (tmo_loan_rec_id / writeback_status='sent') and associate+mark accepted locally instead of calling NewLoan (or call an UpdateLoan endpoint); (2) hide/disable the 'Accept and send to TMO' button in lib/ui--browser--efs/portal/admin/full_applications.tsx:424 when the app/loan is already in TMO. Design Q: on accept of an already-in-TMO loan, associate-only (no TMO call) or also push UpdateLoan? Relates to #dzmm/#37ah/#214f.
- [/] [#214f] [recommended] Gate investor deal publish on acceptance: admin_deal_publish_ (app/equityfundingsource/lib/admin/repo.ts:2054) + POST /api/admin/loans/:id/deal publish a loan to the investor marketplace with NO acceptance check (only 'if (!loan) throw'); any non-Funded loan becomes status='published'. So a deal can be an Available Deal while its application is not accepted (observed: investment_deal 7a0c1463 published from loan 45ddae53 status='submitted', tmo 'Application Received', with NO full_application row). Decide the business rule ('accepted before available') and add the gate before status='published' (and/or surface why a loan is ineligible to publish). Relates to the full_applications<->loans<->investment_deals decoupling.
- [/] [#5eq8] Closing docs step (redesign): rebuild the closing-documents/notarization flow as its own step (replaces the removed Final Loan Documents section). Closing docs are wet-ink signed AND notarized on PAPER (not e-signed); EFS records a signed-status flag (+ final_docs_* D1 columns preserved) and that signed status is a BI-DIRECTIONAL sync with TMO (EFS <-> TMO), not an in-app e-signature flow. Re-introduces a notarize control and SHOULD re-gate allocation wire status (Sent/Confirmed) on notarization — the UI gate + server 409 were removed in the 2026-06-18 AvailableDeal restructure so funding is not hard-blocked in the interim.
- [/] [#efs-cutover-sso-plan] Workers.dev to custom-domain/SSO closeout: write and execute a cutover checklist for equityfundingsource.com/www routing, /login/access-callback, rollback, and Google Workspace SSO after #m6ch credentials arrive. Advances #next-steps.
- [/] [#zwws-vestings-local] [recommended] Investor dashboard phase 4 local half: capture/display vestings and special instructions in EFS D1/UI with tmo_cache_outbox enqueue; leave TMO push gated on #dzmm/#7a4d. Advances #zwws.
- [/] [#67v2-auto-advance] Admin pipeline auto-advance: define stage requirement checks from the TMO-aligned Kanban, run them against D1/tmo_cache, and enqueue audited status updates; keep replay gated by #dzmm. Advances #67v2.
- [/] [#jnzs-approval-followup] [recommended] Send/track funded-deals approval packet: attach current screenshots/copy/lien-position language plus the full_application ESIGN/UETA disclosure excerpt, record Judith/EFS reviewer decision, and convert requested edits into implementation backlog. Advances #jnzs.
- [/] [#xcvg-prod-email] [recommended] Borrower secure-message email production pass: after #f4rq/#m6ch/#p40t or #z3kx path-of-record is decided, enable borrower/admin outbound notifications, verify inbound reply threading, and add production env/runbook checks. Advances #xcvg.
- [/] [#dzmm-writeback-replay] EFS->TMO writeback replay: once #7a4d field map and #k2xg support answers arrive, replay tmo_cache_outbox with idempotency keys, conflict logging, retry/dead-letter state, and tests across broker/admin/investor writebacks. Advances #dzmm/#37ah/#67v2/#zwws.
- [/] [#xcvg] [recommended] Borrower message email round-trip: email notification when a borrower sends a secure-portal message, inbound email reply that appends back into the D1 chat, and a borrower-facing email when an admin replies. Builds on the shipped chat_sessions/chat_messages + admin owner. Gated on a verified Resend EFS sending domain (f4rq) and Google Workspace SMTP (m6ch/p40t). (Distinct from the operator/comms emails to Judith + Robert.)
- [/] [#jnzs] [recommended] Await Judith or EFS reviewer approval on funded-deal images, copy, and lien-position wording before invoicing or launch sign-off. The funded-deals page carries no standalone legal/disclosure text; the disclosure needing legal review is the ESIGN/UETA Electronic record and signature disclosure on the borrower full-application/document-uploads flow (full_application.tsx). Funded-deals copy was reframed as real closed deals and shipped.
- [/] [#67v2] Admin loan pipeline: TMO-aligned stages + Kanban (drag cards, auto-advance when stage requirements met) synced to dashboard; mirror TMO stages as single source of truth. From 2026-06-03 call. Relates to #dzmm/#k2xg.
- [/] [#zwws] [recommended] Investor dashboard rework — remaining phases are externally gated: 4 vestings/special-instructions (TMO writeback-gated #dzmm/#k2xg/#7a4d); 6 new-deal email + workflow-priority dashboard (#f4rq). Shipped: P1 nav (30037e3), P2 dashboard-composite landing (3e06907), P2b interest-button + distributions/statements cleanup (efs cd4253a), P3 simplified portfolio (8d40c66), P5 accreditation→annual Requirements (efs 1957f64). Plan: src/equityfundingsource-dev/prds/rpzm-investor-dashboard-rework.md. Queue one phase at a time.
- [/] [#next-steps] Remaining EFS workers.dev production state: D1 API token unblocked (Cloudflare API token at `passage btak/d1/CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`); migrations 0025/0026 are already applied; Cloudflare Access env vars are deployed for /login/access-callback on workers.dev using the one-time PIN IdP. Custom domain cutover remains intentionally deferred; true Google Workspace SSO remains gated on Google admin credentials.
- [/] [#dzmm] TMO webhooks UNAVAILABLE per operator (2026-06-13). Read-side tightened polling is shipped (scheduled tmo-sync with configurable interval + due-gating + tmo_cache read mirror). Remaining gated: EFS to TMO writeback (tmo_cache_outbox replay) needs the #7a4d write field map + #k2xg support answers before it can replay.
- [/] [#dropbox-sync-adapter] Dropbox sync adapter: #dropbox-sync-contract shipped the shared documents Dropbox metadata, document_sync_logs idempotency schema, pure sync planner, and mocked adapter tests. Remaining: after Dropbox access is available, wire the real credential-backed worker to push/pull R2_DOCUMENTS with retries, backfill, tombstone replay, and per-document sync logs.
