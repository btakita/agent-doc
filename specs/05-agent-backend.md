# Agent Backend

## Trait

`fn send(prompt, session_id, fork, model) -> (text, session_id)`

## Resolution Order

1. CLI `--agent` flag
2. Frontmatter `agent` field
3. Config `default_agent`
4. Fallback: `"claude"`

## Claude Backend

Default: `claude -p --output-format json --permission-mode acceptEdits`. Session handling: `--resume {id}` or `--continue --fork-session`. Appends `--append-system-prompt` with document-mode instructions. Removes `CLAUDECODE` env var. Parses JSON: `result`, `session_id`, `is_error`.

## Prompt Contract

For resumed document turns, the prompt must include:

1. The unified diff since the last run
2. The full current document
3. An ordered `user-authored prompt-bearing changes` section extracted from the diff

That section is oldest-first and uses explicit subtypes:
- `prompt_target` — user-authored prompts that require a response
- `content_edit` — user corrections the agent must incorporate as the new source of truth
- `recovery_artifact` — likely missed/uncommitted response material that should route through repair/session-check logic
- `boundary_artifact` — transient boundary / `(HEAD)` churn that should be normalized, not answered

A turn is not complete until each `prompt_target` item is answered or explicitly grouped into one response. The prompt must also tell the agent to incorporate `content_edit` items and normalize artifact items instead of treating them as ordinary conversation.

## Custom Backends

Config overrides `command` and `args` for any agent name.
